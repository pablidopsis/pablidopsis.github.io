	abstract = {The consequences to fitness of several types of small age-specific effects on mortality are formulated mathematically. An effect of given form always has a larger consequence, or at least one as large, when it occurs earlier. By reference to a model in which mortality is constant it is shown that this implication cannot be avoided by any conceivable organism. A basis for the theory that senescence is an inevitable outcome of evolution is thus established. The simple theory cannot explain specially high infant mortalities. Fisher's “reproductive value”, the form of which gave rise to an erroneous opinion on this point, is shown to be not directly relevant to the situation. Infant mortality may evolve when the early death of one infant makes more likely the creation or survival of a close relative. Similarly, post-reproductive life-spans may evolve when the old animal still benefits its younger relatives. The model shows that higher fertility will be a primary factor leading to the evolution of higher rates of senescence unless the resulting extra mortality is confined to the immature period. Some more general analytical notes on the consequences of modifications to the reproductive schedule are given. Applications to species with populations in continual fluctuation are briefly discussed. Such species apart, it is argued that general stationarity of population can be assumed, in which case the measurement of consequences to fitness in terms of consequences to numerical expectation of offspring is justified. All the age-functions discussed are illustrated by graphs derived from the life-table of the Taiwanese about 1906, and the method of computation is shown.},

A huge body of work has examined the mechanisms by which flowering plants correctly time their entry into the reproductive phase (the ‘floral transition’). However, the corresponding mechanisms by which plants exit the reproductive phase remain relatively neglected. In this review, we identify four developmental processes that contribute to the end-of-flowering; floral arrest, inflorescence meristem arrest, inflorescence activation and ‘vegetative transition’. We highlight that, due to the highly divergent nature of reproductive systems among flowering plants, these processes are differently important for end-of-flowering in different species. For each of these processes, we examine recent advances in understanding the regulatory mechanisms that govern the process, and how these mechanisms determine the timing of end-of-flowering.},

	abstract = {A well-defined set of regulatory pathways control entry into the reproductive phase in flowering plants, but little is known about the mechanistic control of the end-of-flowering despite this being a critical process for optimization of fruit and seed production. Complete fruit removal, or lack of fertile fruit-set, prevents timely inflorescence arrest in Arabidopsis, leading to a previous proposal that a cumulative fruit/seed-derived signal causes simultaneous ‘global proliferative arrest’. Recent studies have suggested that inflorescence arrest involves gene expression changes in the inflorescence meristem that are, at least in part, controlled by the FRUITFULL–APETALA2 pathway; however, there is limited understanding of how this process is coordinated at the whole-plant level. Here, we provide a framework for the communication previously inferred in the global proliferative arrest model. We show that the end-of-flowering in Arabidopsis is not ‘global’ and does not occur synchronously between branches, but rather that the arrest of each inflorescence is a local process, driven by auxin export from fruit proximal to the inflorescence apex. Furthermore, we show that inflorescences are competent for arrest only once they reach a certain developmental age. Understanding the regulation of inflorescence arrest will be of major importance to extending and maximizing crop yields.},

	abstract = {As they grow old, most organisms experience progressive physiological deterioration resulting in declining rates of survival and reproduction – a seemingly maladaptive phenomenon known as senescence. Although senescence is usually defined with respect only to survival and reproduction, a third component of fitness, offspring quality, may also decline with age. Few studies, however, have assessed age-related changes in offspring quality using measures that truly reflect fitness. In a controlled environment, we tested for age-related declines in three demographic components of fitness (survival, reproduction and offspring quality) in Lemna minor, a small aquatic plant in the subfamily Lemnoideae (the duckweeds) with a short life span and rapid rate of asexual reproduction. Our primary measure of offspring quality, the intrinsic rate of increase, more closely approximates fitness than measures used in previous studies such as size, life span and total reproductive output. We observed strong age-related declines in all three components of fitness: old plants had lower rates of survival and reproduction, and produced lower-quality offspring than younger plants. Theoretical and empirical research on the evolutionary biology of senescence should devote more attention to offspring quality. This often unrecognized component of fitness may change with age – as we have shown in L. minor – and may be shaped by, and feed back into, the same evolutionary forces that give rise to senescence.},

	abstract = {Premise of the Study A trade-off between fertility and offspring viability underpins plant reproductive response to sub-optimal environmental conditions. Senescence involves internal resource limitation, and it is a sub-optimal body condition. We tested if senescence affects age-specific fertility and seed viability (quality) in indeterminate annuals. Methods Fertility in individual pods on the monopodial indeterminate inflorescence of Arabidopsis thaliana and its big-seeded relative Brassica nigra was quantified. The reproductive phase was divided into three phases: (1) early-senescence (initial flowers) (2) mid-senescence and (3) late-senescence (wilting leaves). Seed-viability probability as a function of pod position on the inflorescence (a proxy for parent's age) and seed position within pod was verified by germination tests in Brassica and then analysed using a binomial logistic regression model. Key Results Age-specific fertility increased gradually, peaked, and then declined significantly during senescence in Arabidopsis and Brassica. Acropetal size distribution of rosette leaves was similar to that of pods (age-specific fertility) in Arabidopsis. Seeds positioned closest to stigma tended to be heavier and more viable than others in highly fertile pods, characteristic of mid-senescence phase in Brassica. Pod position (parent's age) was a significant predictor of seed-viability probability or seed quality, which improved in old and senescing Brassica. Conclusions High viability probability of seeds produced in low-fertility pods during late-senescence phase suggests weakening of maternal control over seed-size optimization (bigger, fewer, and better seeds) in internally resource-depleted older parent plants. Proximity to stigma can increase seed quality. The unexpected increase in fertility and seed viability during early-senescence phase is likely due to highly conserved developmental constraints on leaf and pod phenotype. Indeterminate annuals can shed light on fertility, offspring quality and senescence relationships in all plants that reproduce sexually and indeterminately.},

A mechanism for photoperiodic time measurement is present in leaves, and the day-length-specific induction of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene, which encodes florigen, is a major final output of the pathway. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which photoperiodic information is perceived in order to trigger FT expression in Arabidopsis as well as in the primary cereals wheat, barley, and rice. In these plants, the differences in photoperiod are measured by interactions between circadian-clock-regulated components, such as CONSTANS (CO), and light signaling. The interactions happen under certain day-length conditions, as previously predicted by the external coincidence model. In these plants, the coincidence mechanisms are governed by multilayered regulation with numerous conserved as well as unique regulatory components, highlighting the breadth of photoperiodic regulation across plant species.},

The photoperiod pathway refers to regulation of ﬂowering in response to day length and quality of light perceived. The gibberellin pathway refers to the requirement of gibberellic acid for normal ﬂowering patterns. The autonomous pathway refers to endogenous regulators that are independent of the photoperiod and gibberellin pathways. Most recently, an endogenous pathway that adds plant age to the control of ﬂowering time has been described. The molecular mechanisms of these pathways have been studied extensively in Arabidopsis thaliana and several other ﬂowering plants.},

	abstract = {Monocarpic plants have a single reproductive phase, in which their longevity is developmentally programmed by molecular networks. In the reproductive phase of Arabidopsis thaliana, the inflorescence meristem (IM) maintains a central pool of stem cells and produces a limited number of flower primordia, which result in seed formation and the death of the whole plant. In this study, we observed morphological changes in the IM at cellular and intracellular resolutions until the end of the plant life cycle. We observed four biological events during the periods from 1 week after bolting (WAB) till the death of stem cells: (1) the gradual reduction in the size of the IM, (2) the dynamic vacuolation of IM cells, (3) the loss of the expression of the stem cell determinant WUSCHEL (WUS), and (4) the upregulation of the programmed cell death marker BIFUNCTIONAL NUCLEASE1 (BFN1) in association with the death of stem cells. These results indicate that the stem cell population gradually decreases in IM during plant aging and eventually is fully terminated. We further show that the expression of WUS became undetectable in IM at 3 WAB prior to the loss of CLAVATA3 (CLV3) expression at 5 WAB; CLV3 is a negative regulator of WUS. Moreover, clv3 plants showed delayed loss of WUS and lived 6 weeks longer compared with wild-type plants. These results indicated that the prolonged expression of CLV3 at 4–5 WAB may be a safeguard that inhibits the reactivation of WUS and promotes plant death. Finally, through transcriptome analysis, we determined that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the control of plant longevity. Our work presents a morphological and physiological framework for the regulation of plant longevity in Arabidopsis.},

Here we uncover a genetic pathway regulating GPA in Arabidopsis that responds to age-dependent factors and acts in parallel to seed-derived signals. We show that FRUITFULL (FUL), a MADS-box gene involved in flowering and fruit development, has a key role in promoting meristem arrest, as GPA is delayed and fruit production is increased in ful mutants. FUL directly and negatively regulates APETALA2 expression in the shoot apical meristem and maintains the temporal expression of WUSCHEL which is an essential factor for meristem maintenance.},

Here, we characterize the physiological and molecular effects of correlative inhibition by seeds on Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) inflorescences, i.e. global proliferative arrest (GPA) during which all maternal growth ceases upon the production of a given number of seeds. We observed transcriptional responses to growth- and branching-inhibitory hormones, and low mitotic activity in meristems upon GPA, but found that meristems retain their identity and proliferative potential. In shoot tissues, we detected the induction of stress- and senescence-related gene expression upon fruit production and GPA, and a drop in chlorophyll levels, suggestive of altered source-sink relationships between vegetative shoot and reproductive tissues. Levels of shoot reactive oxygen species, however, strongly decreased upon GPA, a phenomenon that is associated with bud dormancy in some perennials. Indeed, gene expression changes in arrested apical inflorescences after fruit removal resembled changes observed in axillary buds following release from apical dominance. This suggests that GPA represents a form of bud dormancy, and that dominance is gradually transferred from growing inflorescences to maturing seeds, allowing offspring control over maternal resources, simultaneously restricting offspring number. This would provide a mechanistic explanation for the constraint between offspring quality and quantity.},

Plants, particularly in the tropics, vary enormously with respect to these main variables of flowering. We used data from 302 tree species in a wet tropical forest to test a series of predictions regarding timing, duration, and frequency of flowering and examined the effect of each variable on the other two. Because timing, duration, and frequency of flowering can be constrained by phylogeny, we analyzed the data before and after considering phylogenetic effects at the level of family. Flowering activity peaked in the first wet season from May to July, refuting our prediction of peak flowering during the dry season. Our prediction that most species should flower several times a year was supported when species flowering more or less continually throughout the year were included in this category. Our prediction that supra-annually flowering species should be the least frequent was also supported with some qualifications. As we predicted, species flowering several times a year bloomed relatively briefly per flowering episode. Our prediction of shorter flowering duration for species flowering in the dry season and for those with a temporal separation between flowering and vegetative growth was also supported. Furthermore, supra-annually flowering species flowered for a shorter duration than annually flowering species and had a higher probability of flowering in the dry season compared to episodically or annually flowering species. Phylogeny significantly constrained variation in flowering frequency, but not in flowering time or duration, among confamilial species.},

Thus, the impact of the average air temperature (T) of September and October on the onset (julian days) of the phenophase 'End of flowering' of C. arvense was studied at two areas of a mountainous region of Nafpaktia, Greece, Evinos River (823 m alt.) and Sarantena (1431 m alt.) for eight consecutive years (2007-2014). Sarantena was characterized as lower values of average T as compared to Evinos River. 'End of flowering' appeared later in Evinos River compared to Sarantena. The earliest and latest onset of 'End of flowering' took place in 2011 and 2012, respectively, for both examined areas. The 'End of flowering' onset correlated positively with the average T of October. The increase of 1 °C caused a delay of the onset of the examined phenophase by 8.49 and 5.70 julian days in Evinos River and Sarantena, respectively. The results of this study may contribute to planning of an effective control program of C. arvense.},

Seed yield was unrelated to time or duration of flowering, but positively correlated with rate of inflorescence production, total inflorescence, burr and seed numbers, number of seeds per burr, and seed size. Rate of inflorescence production was the main determinant of total inflorescence numbers per unit area and an important determinant of total burr and seed numbers per unit area. It was negatively related to flowering duration, and weakly so to seed size. Seed size was unrelated to strain maturity. Seeds of small-seeded and fast-flowering strains on average attained viability faster than those of large-seeded and slow-flowering strains. Number of seeds per burr increased slightly with lateness of flowering, but was unrelated to seed size or flowering rate. It is concluded that rapid flowering and high seed number per burr should be useful primary selection criteria in selecting subterranean clovers for seed yield and general adaptation in southern Australia.},

A set of 35 durum wheat genotypes of spring growth-habit involving different allelic combinations at Ppd-A1 and Ppd-B1 genes was grown for 2 years at four sites at latitudes ranging from 19°N to 41°N. The emergence-flowering period was reduced from north to south. The frequency in the collection of the insensitive allele GS-105 at Ppd-A1 was greater (34\%) than that of allele GS-100 (20\%). Genotypes that flowered earlier due to the presence of alleles causing photoperiod insensitivity extended their grain-filling period, but less than the shortening in flowering time. The effect of the allele conferring photoperiod sensitivity at Ppd-A1 was stronger than that at Ppd-B1 (Ppd-A1b {\textgreater} Ppd-B1b). The effect of photoperiod insensitivity alleles was classified as GS-100 {\textgreater} GS-105 {\textgreater} Ppd-B1a. The phenotypic expression of alleles conferring photoperiod insensitivity at Ppd-A1 increased at sites with average day length from emergence to flowering lower than 12 h. An interaction effect was found between Ppd-A1 and Ppd-B1. Differences between allelic combinations in flowering time accounted for c. 66\% of the variability induced by the genotype effect, with the remaining 34\% being explained by genes controlling earliness per se. The shortest flowering time across sites corresponded to the allelic combination GS-100/Ppd-B1a, which reduced flowering time by 11 days irrespective of the Ppd-A1b/Ppd-B1b combination. The current study marks a further step towards elucidation of the phenotypic expression of genes regulating photoperiod sensitivity and their interaction with the environment.},

Here, we investigated the relationship between flowering phenology, abiotic factors, and plant functional attributes, while controlling for phylogenetic relationship among species, in a dry forest community in Mexico. METHODS: We characterized flowering phenology (time and duration) and pollination syndromes of 55 tree species, 49 herbs, 24 shrubs, 15 lianas, and 11 vines. We tested the influence of pollination syndrome, growth form, and abiotic factors on flowering phenology using phylogenetic generalized least squares. KEY RESULTS: We found a relationship between flowering duration and time. Growth form was related to flowering time, and the pollination syndrome had a more significant relationship with flowering duration. Flowering time variation in the community was explained mainly by abiotic variables, without an important phylogenetic effect. Flowering time in lianas and trees was negatively and positively correlated with daylength, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Functional attributes, environmental cues, and phylogeny interact with each other to shape the diversity of flowering patterns. Phenological differentiation among species groups revealed multiples strategies associated with growth form and pollination syndromes that can be important for understanding species coexistence in this highly diverse plant community.},

However, empirical evidence linking specific aspects of plant flowering phenology to the number of flowers produced is limited, particularly under future global climate change. We used phenology measurements after 2, 3, 6, and 7 years of a fully factorial, climate change field experiment in an alpine meadow pasture on the central Tibetan Plateau to understand: 1) how experimental warming and snow addition affect the date of first and last flowering in related forb and shrub species, Potentilla saundersiana Royle and Potentilla fruticosa L.; and 2) how these changes in the timing of phenological events alter flowering duration and production, as a proxy for reproductive effort. We found that warming significantly advanced the date of first flowering in both P. fruticosa and P. saundersiana, with no other significant effects on flowering duration or production. In contrast to warming, simulated snowstorms delayed the date of first flowering in P. saundersiana, but had no significant effect on P. fruticosa. There were no significant treatment interactions. For both species, flower production increased as the last date of flowering occurred later. These results indicate that as climate change alters alpine plant phenology, advances in the timing of first flowering alone will not necessarily translate to increases in flowering duration and enhanced reproductive effort. Instead, these findings demonstrate the importance of the date of last flowering in mediating plant reproductive effort and success.},

At key stages during the life cycle profound changes occur, and perhaps one of the most critical of these is during seed ﬁlling. By restricting the competition for reserves in Arabidopsis plants, the ability to manipulate seed size, seed weight, or seed content has been explored. Removal of secondary inﬂorescences and lateral branches resulted in a stimulation of elongation of the primary inﬂorescence and an increase in the distance between siliques. The pruning treatment also led to the development of longer and larger siliques that contained fewer, bigger seeds. This seems to be a consequence of a reduction in the number of ovules that develop and an increase in the fatty acid content of the seeds that mature. The data show that shoot architecture could have a substantial impact on the partitioning of reserves between vegetative and reproductive tissues and could be an important trait for selection in rapid phenotyping screens to optimize crop performance.},

Crop breeding programmes still largely focus on increasing yield, particularly in the light of the goal to feedan ever-increasing global population. Most crops originatefrom R-strategy plants, yet breeding programmes arefrequently orientated towards C-strategy plants. In thosecountries where land use for crops is marginal and abioticstress levels are high, it might be more desirable to select forS-strategy plants. Although S-strategy plants can be overgrown by competitors in a wild habitat, in farmed land thisis manageable through weed control or less dense seedplanting rates. A crop ideotype would be an S-strategyplant with the ability of an R-strategy plant to reproducerapidly when the environmental conditions become harsh,thus ensuring at least a minimum yield each year.
This analysis suggests that if the targetis to increase the number of viable seeds per pod, theconsequence should be further mobilization of lipid andprotein content into each individual pod, which will resultin a redistribution of these resources amongst a greaternumber of seeds within those pods. However, the overallmass of seeds per pod is unlikely to be increased so theusefulness of increasing seed number is limited to production scenarios where the aim is to increase the numberof seeds that can give rise to viable plants, for example seedproduction for the leafy vegetable market. If the target is to increase seed size and nutrient content per se, then it isnecessary to alter the source–sink relationship within theplant and to start to shift the architecture away from that of an obligate R-strategy plant and towards that of an S- orC-strategy plant.},

There is a lot of ecological insight here, linking with K/r strategies and Grime's 3 strategies for resource allocation.
Can a R-strategy plant (Arabidopsis) invest additional resources in seeds (increasing seed size, yield and quality)?
The more branches are removed, the greater the decrease in sink strength.
They way they actually make conclusions out of the data is insanely brilliant, pointing out implications of everything from an economic/production point of view.},
	annote = {Results

Removing all secondaries did NOT affect he number of fruits in the PI, it just made the inflorescence longer.
When removing branches, the rosette shows more leaves and biomass, but the rate of senescence of individual leaves is unaffected. [I have to check Nooden \& Penney, 2001 to make sense of this].

 

The resulting pods are longer and have bigger area. Inside them, we find less seeds per pod, but the total weight of seeds is greater.
Basically, when branches are removed Arabidopsis somehow becomes less R-strategist and invests on fewer but bigger seeds (I think) [my own interpretation].
Additionally, this indicates that the sink strength of the reproductive part is determined by the number of pods rather than the number of seeds.
This makes sense because all seeds from a pod are released at the same time, so the developmental rate of seeds must be coordinated.
If no. of pods is too little, they won't be able to pull enough resources from the rosette, and so it makes sense that the pod is able to take this into account to make sure less but bigger seeds are developed.
How a pod measures the amount of resource is a mystery!
If sink strength is low then not all the potential sites of attachment in a pod are used to develop seeds.

While late-developing inflorescences of Torch terminated flowering later than early-developing inflorescences, all inflorescences on Tower terminated flowering at about the same time. All flower initials that gave rise to open flowers were clearly visible on individual inflorescences soon after flowering commenced. Abortion, the failure of pods to elongate, increase in girth and become seed-bearing, was substantial for both varieties and both seedings. Abortion occurred predominantly towards the end of the flowering period or after, and was most prevalent on the later-developing inflorescences. The pattern of flower and pod development in rapeseed indicates a potential for recovery from hail or other injuries early in flowering.

Neither male‐ and female‐sterility mutations (ms1‐1 and bell1, respectively) nor surgical removal of the stems with inflorescences (bolts) at various stages significantly increased the longevity of individual rosette leaves, yet the mutants and treated plants lived 20–50 d longer, measured by the death of the last rosette and/or the last cauline leaf. A series of growth mutations (clv2‐4, clv3‐2, det3, vam1 enh, and dark green) also increased plant longevity by 20–30 d but did not delay the overall development of the plants. The mutations prolonged plant life through the production of new leaves and stems with inflorescences (bolts) rather than by extending leaf longevity. In growing stems, the newly‐formed leaves may induce senescence in the older leaves; however, removal of the younger leaves did not significantly increase the life of the older leaves on the compressed stems of Arabidopsis. Since plants that produce more bolts also live longer, the reproductive load (dry weight) of the bolts did not seem to drive leaf or whole plant senescence here. The developing reproductive structures caused the death of the plant by preventing regeneration of leaves and bolts, which are green and presumably photosynthetic. They also exerted a correlative control (repression) on the development of additional reproductive structures.},

The rate of increase of fitness to survive (as measured by survival) is equal to the genetic component of the variance; the larger the change introduced by a mutant, or the closer the adaptation, the smaller will be the chance of improvement; changes in the environment must also be taken into account. Dominance is regarded as having arisen from the selective influence of modifying factors. Mutant genes which are not wiped out fortuitously or by adverse selection within the first few generations have an excellent chance of establishing themselves, even with very small advantages and low mutation rates. Sexual selection may be of great importance, under favorable circumstances, in aiding the fission of species. Mimicry provides an especially instructive example of complex adaptation. In man differential fertility is the principal menace to the species, and appears to be due to (1) the inheritance of fertility, and (2) the social promotion of the infertile; it could be controlled by rather moderate social changes.

In the wild-type Landsberg erecta (Ler) line, flower production ceases coordinately on all inflorescence branches by a process we have designated global proliferative arrest (GPA). Morphological studies indicate that GPA involves a cessation of proliferative activity at the meristems, but a retention of the structural characteristics of the proliferating meristems. GPA does not occur in the male-sterile (msl-7) line, nor in wild-type Ler when fruits are surgically removed. In these cases, inflorescence meristems continue to proliferate, ultimately terminating by a different process, designated terminal differentiation, in which disruptions in patterning at the apex are followed by the loss of the inflorescence meristem. We present an argument that GPA is mediated by a specific communication system between inflorescence meristems and developing fruits. Analysis of reduced-fertility mutants provided evidence that GPA is dependent on seed development specifically. Mutations conferring hormone deficiency or insensitivity did not disrupt the correlative interactions leading to GPA.},

Transient expression of FT in the phloem companion cells of rosette leaves for one to several days was previously shown to be sufficient to commit plants to flowering. Here we show that partial commitment results in pleiotropic inflorescence meristem reversion phenotypes. FT expression is much stronger in organs formed after the floral transition such as cauline leaves, sepals, and developing siliques. We show that expression of FT and its paralog TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) after the floral transition plays a role in inflorescence meristem stabilization even if plants flower very late in development. CONSTANS (CO), the major activator of FT, is not required to prevent late reproductive reversion. The requirement for FT is temporal since reproductive reversion to a vegetative state occurs only in recently formed inflorescence meristems. Unlike for the expression of FT in leaves, neither the distal putative FT enhancer nor long-day photoperiod is required for FT expression in developing siliques. Expression of FT in developing siliques and their supporting stems is sufficient to stabilize flowering during the sensitive developmental window indicating that fruit generated FT participates in inflorescence stabilization.},

For monocarpic plants, proper senescence timing is very important as the final production of plants depends on it. Citing available literatures, this review discusses how plants not only may delay senescence until after they reproduce successfully, but they may also bring senescence time forward, in order to reproduce in favored conditions. It demonstrates that even though senescence is part of aging, it does not necessarily mean plants have to reach a certain age to senesce. Experiments using different aged plants have suggested that in interest of their final outcome and fitness, plants carefully weigh out environmental cues and transit to next developmental phase at proper time, even if that means transiting to terminal senescence phase earlier and shortening their lifespan. How much plants have control over senescence timing and how they balance internal and external signals for that is not well understood. Future studies are needed to identify processes that trigger senescence timing in response to environment and investigate genetic/epigenetic mechanisms behind it.},

	abstract = {The end of the reproductive phase in monocarpic plants is determined by a coordinated arrest of all active meristems, a process known as global proliferative arrest (GPA). GPA is linked to the correlative control exerted by developing seeds and, possibly, the establishment of strong source-sink relationships. It has been proposed that the meristems that undergo arrest at the end of the reproductive phase behave at the transcriptomic level as dormant meristems, with low mitotic activity and high expression of abscisic acid response genes. Meristem arrest is also controlled genetically. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the MADS-box transcription factor FRUITFULL induces GPA by directly repressing genes of the APETALA2 (AP2) clade. The AP2 genes maintain shoot apical meristem (SAM) activity in part by keeping WUSCHEL expression active, but the mechanisms downstream of this pathway remain elusive. To identify target genes, we performed a transcriptomic analysis, inducing AP2 activity in meristems close to arrest. Our results suggest that AP2 controls meristem arrest by repressing genes related to axillary bud dormancy in the SAM and negative regulators of cytokinin signaling. In addition, our analysis indicates that genes involved in the response to environmental signals also respond to AP2, suggesting that it could modulate the end of flowering by controlling responses to both endogenous and exogenous signals. Our results support the previous observation that at the end of the reproductive phase the arrested SAM behaves as a dormant meristem, and they strongly support AP2 as a master regulator of this process.},

	abstract = {In monocarpic plants, all reproductive meristem activity arrests and flower production ceases after the production of a certain number of fruits. This proliferative arrest (PA) is an evolutionary adaptation that ensures nutrient availability for seed production. Moreover, PA is a process of agronomic interest because it affects the duration of the flowering period and therefore fruit production. While our knowledge of the inputs and genetic factors controlling the initiation of the flowering period is extensive, little is known about the regulatory pathways and cellular events that participate in the end of flowering and trigger PA. Here, we characterize with high spatiotemporal resolution the cellular and molecular changes related to cell proliferation and meristem activity in the shoot apical meristem throughout the flowering period and PA. Our results suggest that cytokinin (CK) signaling repression precedes PA and that this hormone is sufficient to prevent and revert the process. We have also observed that repression of known CK downstream factors, such as type B cyclins and WUSCHEL (WUS), correlates with PA. These molecular changes are accompanied by changes in cell size and number likely caused by the cessation of cell division and WUS activity during PA. Parallel assays in fruitfull (ful) mutants, which do not undergo PA, have revealed that FUL may promote PA via repression of these CK-dependent pathways. Moreover, our data allow to define two phases, based on the relative contribution of FUL, that lead to PA: an early reduction of CK-related events and a late blocking of these events.},

However, no studies have quantified the level of synchronisation of reproductive timing relative to germination timing under natural conditions. In a sequential seeding experiment (SSE) in which we manipulated the germination timing of Arabidopsis thaliana accessions, we developed a quantification index to evaluate reproductive synchrony in annual plants. In the SSE, we identified a novel phenomenon of reproductive synchrony: senescence synchrony. The role of vernalisation in realising flowering synchrony between plants of different ages under natural conditions was demonstrated by synchronisation and de-synchronisation of flowering initiation in vernalisation-sensitive and less-vernalisation-sensitive accessions, respectively. We also observed up-regulation of senescence-related genes at corresponding times. The approach we developed in this study provides a set of concepts and procedures that can be used to study reproductive synchrony experimentally under natural conditions.},

Within any treatment, leaf number was a linear function of thermal time from seedling emergence (°C.d, the mean daily temperatures summed above a base temperature of 0°C) but the slope of the relation depended on sowing date. Leaf appearance rate doubled from October to February sowings, for which it was maximum, and usually decreased for later sowings. However, when expressed on the basis of photothermal time (°C.dl, temperatures accumulated during the light time period only), much of the sowing date effect was removed, except for the latest spring sowings. For these late sowings, leaf appearance rate was usually slower than expected. The authors conclude that both temperature and photoperiod are determinants of leaf appearance rate, and suggest that the slow rate for late sowings may be caused by a non-linear response to the higher temperatures experienced by the plant during that part of the year. The genotypic differences indicate that it may also be associated with a lack of vernalization. The use of photothermal time rather than thermal time significantly improves prediction of leaf number. However, it still provides only an empirical description of the dependence of leaf number on time and climate.},

	abstract = {Flowering time is a key life-history trait in the plant life cycle. Most studies to unravel the genetics of flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana have been performed under greenhouse conditions. Here, we describe a study about the genetics of flowering time that differs from previous studies in two important ways: first, we measure flowering time in a more complex and ecologically realistic environment; and, second, we combine the advantages of genome-wide association (GWA) and traditional linkage (QTL) mapping. Our experiments involved phenotyping nearly 20,000 plants over 2 winters under field conditions, including 184 worldwide natural accessions genotyped for 216,509 SNPs and 4,366 RILs derived from 13 independent crosses chosen to maximize genetic and phenotypic diversity. Based on a photothermal time model, the flowering time variation scored in our field experiment was poorly correlated with the flowering time variation previously obtained under greenhouse conditions, reinforcing previous demonstrations of the importance of genotype by environment interactions in A. thaliana and the need to study adaptive variation under natural conditions. The use of 4,366 RILs provides great power for dissecting the genetic architecture of flowering time in A. thaliana under our specific field conditions. We describe more than 60 additive QTLs, all with relatively small to medium effects and organized in 5 major clusters. We show that QTL mapping increases our power to distinguish true from false associations in GWA mapping. QTL mapping also permits the identification of false negatives, that is, causative SNPs that are lost when applying GWA methods that control for population structure. Major genes underpinning flowering time in the greenhouse were not associated with flowering time in this study. Instead, we found a prevalence of genes involved in the regulation of the plant circadian clock. Furthermore, we identified new genomic regions lacking obvious candidate genes.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Analysis is made of leaf numbers observed in the field for several wheat genotypes over a wide range of sowing dates. Within any treatment, leaf number was a linear function of thermal time from seedling emergence (°C.d, the mean daily temperatures summed above a base temperature of 0°C) but the slope of the relation depended on sowing date. Leaf appearance rate doubled from October to February sowings, for which it was maximum, and usually decreased for later sowings. However, when expressed on the basis of photothermal time (°C.dl, temperatures accumulated during the light time period only), much of the sowing date effect was removed, except for the latest spring sowings. For these late sowings, leaf appearance rate was usually slower than expected. The authors conclude that both temperature and photoperiod are determinants of leaf appearance rate, and suggest that the slow rate for late sowings may be caused by a non-linear response to the higher temperatures experienced by the plant during that part of the year. The genotypic differences indicate that it may also be associated with a lack of vernalization. The use of photothermal time rather than thermal time significantly improves prediction of leaf number. However, it still provides only an empirical description of the dependence of leaf number on time and climate.},

Soil strength, N nutrition, and depth of sowing affect rate of leaf emergence, as may sub-zero temperature or ontogeny. An alternative hypothesis proposes that leaf emergence rate depends on daylength and acclimation to temperature. Potential rate of leaf emergence may be determined by factors acting on leaf primordia, which are initiated early in the life cycle.},

Winter cold in A. thaliana promotes flowering by repressing transcription of the MADS box gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). The mechanism by which this occurs involves a complex interplay of different forms of long noncoding RNAs induced at the FLC locus during cold and changes in the chromatin of FLC. In perennial relatives of A. thaliana, flowering also requires the age-dependent downregulation of miRNA156 before winter.},

	abstract = {To maximise their reproductive success, flowering plants must correctly time their entry into and exit from the reproductive phase (flowering). While much is known about the mechanisms that regulate the initiation of flowering, the regulation of end-of-flowering remains largely uncharacterised. End-of-flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana consists of the quasi-synchronous arrest of individual inflorescences, but it is unclear how this arrest is correctly timed with respect to environmental stimuli and ongoing reproductive success. Here we show that Arabidopsis inflorescence arrest is a complex developmental phenomenon which includes a decline in size and cessation of activity in the inflorescence meristem (IM), coupled with a separable developmental arrest in all unopened floral primordia (floral arrest); these events occur well before the visible arrest of the inflorescence. We show that global removal of inflorescences can delay both IM arrest and floral arrest, but that local fruit removal only delays floral arrest, emphasising the separability of these processes. We test a role for cytokinin in regulating inflorescence arrest, and find that cytokinin treatment can delay arrest. We further show that gain-of-function cytokinin receptor hypersensitive mutants can delay floral arrest, and also IM arrest, depending on the expression pattern of the receptor; conversely, loss-of-function mutants prevent extension of flowering in response to inflorescence removal. Collectively, our data suggest that the dilution of cytokinin among an increasing number of sink organs leads to end-of-flowering in Arabidopsis by triggering IM and floral arrest, conversely meaning that a lack of reproductive success can homeostatically extend flowering in compensation.},

	abstract = {Background
A huge variety of plant forms can be found in nature. This is particularly noticeable for inflorescences, the region of the plant that contains the flowers. The architecture of the inflorescence depends on its branching pattern and on the relative position where flowers are formed. In model species such as Arabidopsis thaliana or Antirrhinum majus the key genes that regulate the initiation of flowers have been studied in detail and much is known about how they work. Studies being carried out in other species of higher plants indicate that the homologues of these genes are also key regulators of the development of their reproductive structures. Further, changes in these gene expression patterns and/or function play a crucial role in the generation of different plant architectures.

Scope
In this review we aim to present a summarized view on what is known about floral initiation genes in different plants, particularly dicotyledonous species, and aim to emphasize their contribution to plant architecture.},

Environmental factors which change in a predictable fashion along the year, such as light and temperature, are the most relevant in terms of selection of the flowering season. In Arabidopsis and more recently in a few other species, molecular genetic analyses are providing a way to identify the genes involved in the regulation of flowering time. From gene sequences it is possible to develop hypotheses regarding molecular function and to infer some of the molecular mechanisms involved in the environmental regulation of flowering time. In this paper, we summarize recent discoveries concerning the mechanisms which plants use to perceive and respond to major environmental factors (light and temperature) and their different components. We focus mainly on annual plants and especially on Arabidopsis because most of the available molecular and functional data come from this species.

In Arabidopsis and more recently in a few other species, molecular genetic analyses are providing a way to identify the genes involved in the regulation of flowering time. From gene sequences it is possible to develop hypotheses regarding molecular function and to infer some of the molecular mechanisms involved in the environmental regulation of flowering time. In this paper, we summarize recent discoveries concerning the mechanisms which plants use to perceive and respond to major environmental factors (light and temperature) and their different components. We focus mainly on annual plants and especially on Arabidopsis because most of the available molecular and functional data come from this species. However, additional information arising from other plant systems is also considered.},

	abstract = {Background: In flowering plants, precise timing of the floral transition is crucial to maximize chances of reproductive success, and as such, this process has been intensively studied. FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) have been identified as closely related eukaryotic phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins (‘EuPEBPs’) that integrate multiple environmental stimuli, and act antagonistically to determine the optimal timing of the floral transition. Extensive research has demonstrated that FT acts similar to hormonal signals, being transported in the phloem from its primary site of expression in leaves to its primary site of action in the shoot meristem; TFL1 also appears to act as a mobile signal. Recent work implicates FT, TFL1, and the other members of the EuPEBP family, in the control of other important processes, suggesting that the EuPEBP family may be key general regulators of developmental transitions in flowering plants. In eudicots, there are a small number of EuPEBP proteins, but in monocots, and particularly grasses, there has been a large, but uncharacterized expansion of EuPEBP copy number, with unknown consequences for the EuPEBP function.
Results: To systematically characterize the evolution of EuPEBP proteins in flowering plants, and in land plants more generally, we performed a high-resolution phylogenetic analysis of 701 PEBP sequences from 208 species. We refine previous models of EuPEBP evolution in early land plants, demonstrating the algal origin of the family, and pin-pointing the origin of the FT/TFL1 clade at the base of monilophytes. We demonstrate how a core set of genes (MFT1, MFT2, FT, and TCB) at the base of flowering plants has undergone differential evolution in the major angiosperm lineages. This includes the radical expansion of the FT family in monocots into 5 core lineages, further re-duplicated in the grass family to 12 conserved clades.
Conclusions: We show that many grass FT proteins are strongly divergent from other FTs and are likely neofunctional regulators of development. Our analysis shows that monocots and eudicots have strongly divergent patterns of EuPEBP evolution.},

Day length is perceived in leaves and induces a systemic signal, called florigen, that moves through the phloem to the shoot apex. At the shoot apical meristem (SAM), florigen causes changes in gene expression that reprogram the SAM to form flowers instead of leaves. Analysis of flowering of Arabidopsis thaliana placed the CONSTANS/FLOWERING LOCUS T (CO/FT) module at the core of a pathway that promotes flowering in response to changes in day length. We describe progress in defining the molecular mechanisms that activate this module in response to changing day length and the increasing evidence that FT protein is a major component of florigen. Finally, we discuss conservation of FT function in other species and how variation in its regulation could generate different flowering behaviors.},

The ga1-3 mutant, which is severely defective in ent-kaurene synthesis because it lacks most of the GA1 gene, never flowered in SD unless treated with exogenous gibberellin. After a prolonged period of vegetative growth, this mutant eventually underwent senescence without having produced flower buds. The gai mutant and the “leaky” ga1-6 mutant did flower in SD, but took somewhat longer than WT. All the mutants flowered readily in CL, although the ga1-3 mutant showed some delay. Unlike WT and ga1-3, the gai mutant failed to respond to gibberellin treatment by accelerating flowering in SD. A cold treatment promoted flowering in the WT and gai, but failed to induce flowering in ga1-3.

FT and SOC1 have been proposed to act in parallel pathways downstream of CO based on genetic analysis using weak ft alleles, since ft soc1 double mutants showed an additive effect in suppressing the early flowering of CO overexpressor plants. However, this genetic analysis was inconsistent with the sequential induction pattern of FT and SOC1 found in inducible CO overexpressor plants. Hence, to identify genetic interactions of CO, FT, and SOC1, we carried out genetic and expression analyses with a newly isolated T-DNA allele of FT, ft-10. We found that ft-10 almost completely suppressed the early flowering phenotype of CO overexpressor plants, whereas soc1-2 partially suppressed the phenotype, suggesting that FT is the major output of CO. Expression of SOC1 was altered in gain- or loss-of-function mutants of FT, whereas expression of FT remained unchanged in gain- or loss-of-function mutants of SOC1, suggesting that FT positively regulates SOC1 to promote flowering. In addition, inactivation of FT caused down-regulation of SOC1 even in plants overexpressing CO, indicating that FT is required for SOC1 induction by CO. Taken together, these data suggest that CO activates SOC1 through FT to promote flowering in Arabidopsis.},

The architecture of the circadian clock involves the autoregulatory transcriptional feedback loops, post‐translational modiﬁcations of core oscillators, and epigenetic modiﬁcations of DNA and histones. Here, light, temperature, humidity, and internal elemental nutrients are summarized to illustrate the sensitivity of the circadian clock to timing cues. In addition, the circadian clock runs cell‐autonomously, driving independent circadian rhythms in various tissues. The core oscillators responds to each other with biochemical factors including calcium ions, mineral nutrients, photosynthetic products, and hormones. We describe clock components sequentially expressed during a 24‐h day that regulate rhythmic growth, aging, immune response, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses.

Thus, some of the genes involved in the response to environmental changes are expected to regulate leaf senescence. Light acts not only as the primary source of energy for photosynthesis but also as an essential environmental cue that directly control plant growth and development including leaf senescence. The molecular mechanisms linking light signaling to leaf senescence have recently emerged, exploring the role of Phytochrome-Interacting Factors (PIFs) as a central player leading to diverse senescence responses, senescence-promoting gene regulatory networks (GRNs) involving PIFs, and structural features of transcription modules in GRNs. The circadian clock is an endogenous time-keeping system for the adaptation of organisms to changing environmental signals and coordinates developmental events throughout the life of the plant. Circadian rhythms can be reset by environmental signals, such as lightdark or temperature cycles, to match the environmental cycle. Research advances have led to the discovery of the role of core clock components as senescence regulators and their underlying signaling pathways, as well as the age-dependent shortening of the circadian clock period. These discoveries highlight the close relationship between the circadian system and leaf senescence. Key issues remain to be elucidated, including the effect of light on leaf senescence in relation to the circadian clock, and the identification of key molecules linking aging, light, and the circadian clock, and integration mechanisms of various senescence-affecting signals at the multi-regulation levels in dynamics point of view.},

              The circadian clock is involved in aging in animals, where mutations in core clock genes accelerate aging. However, little is known about the relationship between aging and the circadian clock in plants. Using the well-studied process of leaf senescence in
              Arabidopsis
              , a higher plant, as a model for aging, we show that the circadian clock has a critical role in regulating the aging process in plants. Specifically, we show that PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 9 (PRR9), a core clock component, positively regulates leaf senescence.

              The circadian clock coordinates the daily cyclic rhythm of numerous biological processes by regulating a large portion of the transcriptome. In animals, the circadian clock is involved in aging and senescence, and circadian disruption by mutations in clock genes frequently accelerates aging. Conversely, aging alters circadian rhythmicity, which causes age-associated physiological alterations. However, interactions between the circadian clock and aging have been rarely studied in plants. Here, we investigated potential roles for the circadian clock in the regulation of leaf senescence in plants. Members of the evening complex in
              Arabidopsis
              circadian clock, EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3), EARLY FLOWERING 4 (ELF4), and LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX), as well as the morning component PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 9 (PRR9), affect both age-dependent and dark-induced leaf senescence. The circadian clock regulates the expression of several senescence-related transcription factors. In particular, PRR9 binds directly to the promoter of the positive aging regulator
              ORESARA1
              (
              ORE1
              ) gene to promote its expression. PRR9 also represses
              miR164
              , a posttranscriptional repressor of
              ORE1
              . Consistently, genetic analysis revealed that delayed leaf senescence of a
              prr9
              mutant was rescued by
              ORE1

              through a feed-forward pathway involving posttranscriptional regulation by
              miR164

Mutants elf3, elf4 and lux have significantly faster dark-induced senescence. No effects in other clock mutants (cca1, lhy, prr7, toc1, gi). Only prr9 is described to have delayed age-dependent senescence.
Expression of transcription factors that are involved in ageing follows circadian rhythms. Specifically, they focus on ORE1, which is down-regulated post-transcriptionally by miR164 and up-regulated by EIN3 during ageing.
Circadian clock negatively regulates the amplitude of ORE1 mRNA levels via anti-phasic expression of miR164. Specifically, this is done transcriptionally, as PRR9 binds to the ORE1 promoter and directly activates it. This involves a novel G-box element. 
It is also described that PRR9 has an additional indirect effect on ORE1. It directly represses miR164B at the transcriptional level. Because miR164B is a repressor of ORE1, this has an impact on ORE1 levels. This is a coherent feed-forward loop.

SOC1 is regulated by two antagonistic flowering regulators, CONSTANS (CO) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), which act as floral activator and repressor, respectively. CO activates SOC1 mainly through FT but FLC represses SOC1 by direct binding to the promoter. SOC1 is also activated by an age-dependent mechanism in which SPL9 and microRNA156 are involved. When SOC1 is induced at the shoot apex, SOC1 together with AGL24 directly activates LEAFY (LFY), a floral meristem identity gene. APETALA1 (AP1), activated mainly by FT, is also necessary to establish and maintain flower meristem identity. When LFY and AP1 are established, flower development occurs at the anlagen of shoot apical meristem according to the ABC model. During early flower development, AP1 activates the A function and represses three redundantly functioning flowering time genes, SOC1, AGL24, and SVP to prevent floral reversion. During late flower development, such repression is also necessary to activate SEPALATA3 (SEP3) which is a coactivator of B and C function genes with LFY, otherwise SEP3 is suppressed by SOC1, AGL24, and SVP. Therefore, SOC1 is necessary to prevent premature differentiation of the floral meristem.},

Transcripts of the Arabidopsis thaliana flowering-promoting gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) are present in leaf tissue but can also promote flowering when artificially introduced into the meristem. FT may normally act in the leaf and/or the meristem, initiating or constituting a mobile flower-promoting signal. We studied FT-dependent events in the rosette leaf, some of which might precede or mimic events in the meristem and its primordia. We show FT-dependent transcript accumulation of the MADS box transcription factors FRUITFULL (FUL) and SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) in leaves. Abnormally high levels of FT further increase the expression of these genes, leading to morphological changes in the leaves. Loss of the flowering-time gene FD, as well as environmental conditions that delay flowering, reduce FT's effect on leaves via reduced activation of its targets. FUL, SEP3, and APETALA1 accumulation in the meristem is associated with and contributes to the transition to flowering. We propose that FT functions through partner-dependent transcriptional activation of these and as-yet-unknown genes and that this occurs at several sites. Organ fate may depend on both degree of activation and the developmental stage reached by the organ before activation occurs.},

Here, we show that TFL1 is recruited to thousands of loci by the bZIP transcription factor FD. We identify the master regulator of floral fate, LEAFY (LFY) as a target under dual opposite regulation by TFL1 and FT and uncover a pivotal role of FT in promoting flower fate via LFY upregulation. We provide evidence that the antagonism between FT and TFL1 relies on competition for chromatin-bound FD at shared target loci. Direct TFL1-FD regulated target genes identify this complex as a hub for repressing both master regulators of reproductive development and endogenous signalling pathways. Our data provide mechanistic insight into how TFL1-FD sculpt inflorescence architecture, a trait important for reproductive success, plant architecture and yield.},

TFL1 and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) have highly conserved amino acid sequences but opposite functions. For example, FT promotes flowering and TFL1 represses it; FT-overexpressing plants and TFL1 loss-of-function mutants have a similar phenotype production of terminal flowers in the shoot apex. FT is believed to function in a transcriptional activator complex by interacting with FD. Here, we demonstrate that TFL1 is involved in the transcriptional repression of genes that are activated by FT. We analyzed transgenic plants overexpressing TFL1 fused to a transcriptional repressor domain (TFL1-SRDX) or an activator domain (TFL1-VP16). Plants carrying 35S:TFL1-SRDX showed delayed flowering similar to 35S:TFL1 plants, and plants carrying 35S:TFL1-VP16 showed an early flowering phenotype and produced terminal flowers. Furthermore, the tfl1 and 35S:TFL1-VP16 plant phenotypes were strongly suppressed by the fd mutation, and TFL1 interacted with FD in the cell nucleus, as shown by bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments. We conclude that TFL1 negatively modulates the FD-dependent transcription of target genes to fine-tune flowering time and the development of the inflorescence meristem.},

              Circadian clocks allow organisms to synchronize their physiological processes to diurnal variations. A phase response curve allows researchers to understand clock entrainment by revealing how signals adjust clock genes differently according to the phase in which they are applied. Comprehensively investigating these curves is difficult, however, because of the cost of measuring them experimentally. Here we demonstrate that fundamental properties of the curve are recoverable from the singularity response, which is easily measured by applying a single stimulus to a cellular network in a desynchronized state (i.e. singularity). We show that the singularity response of
              Arabidopsis
              to light/dark and temperature stimuli depends on the properties of the phase response curve for these stimuli. The measured singularity responses not only allow the curves to be precisely reconstructed but also reveal organ-specific properties of the plant circadian clock. The method is not only simple and accurate, but also general and applicable to other coupled oscillator systems as long as the oscillators can be desynchronized. This simplified method may allow the entrainment properties of the circadian clock of both plants and other species in nature.},

We develop a mathematical model for vernalization that operates on multiple timescales—long term (month), short term (day), and current (hour)—and is constrained by experimental data. Our analysis demonstrates that temperature sensing is not localized to speciﬁc nodes within the FLC network. Instead, temperature sensing is broadly distributed, with each thermosensory process responding to speciﬁc features of the plants’ history of exposure to warm and cold. The model accurately predicts FLC silencing in new ﬁeld data, allowing us to forecast FLC expression in changing climates. We suggest that distributed thermosensing may be a general property of thermoresponsive regulatory networks in complex natural environments.},

In addition to maintaining oscillations in clock gene expression, the EC also participates in temperature and light entrainment, acting as an important environmental sensor and conveying this information to growth and developmental pathways. However, the molecular basis for EC DNA binding specificity and temperature-dependent activity were not known. Here, we solved the structure of the DNA binding domain of LUX in complex with DNA. Residues critical for high-affinity binding and direct base readout were determined and tested via site-directed mutagenesis in vitro and in vivo. Using extensive in vitro DNA binding assays of LUX alone and in complex with ELF3 and ELF4, we demonstrate that, while LUX alone binds DNA with high affinity, the LUX–ELF3 complex is a relatively poor binder of DNA. ELF4 restores binding to the complex. In vitro, the full EC is able to act as a direct thermosensor, with stronger DNA binding at 4 °C and weaker binding at 27 °C. In addition, an excess of ELF4 is able to restore EC binding even at 27 °C. Taken together, these data suggest that ELF4 is a key modulator of thermosensitive EC activity.},

	abstract = {Plants detect changes in day length to induce seasonal patterns of ﬂowering. The photoperiodic pathway accelerates the ﬂowering of Arabidopsis thaliana under long days (LDs) whereas it is inactive under short days (SDs), resulting in delayed ﬂowering. This delay is overcome by exposure of plants to high temperature (27°C) under SDs (27°C-SD). Previously, the high-temperature ﬂowering response was proposed to involve either the impaired activity of MADS-box transcription factor (TF) ﬂoral repressors or PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) TF-mediated activation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), which encodes the output signal of the photoperiodic pathway. We integrate these observations by studying several PIFs, the MADS-box SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) and the photoperiodic pathway under 27°C-SD. We ﬁnd that the mRNAs of FT and its paralogue TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) are increased at dusk under 27°C-SD compared with 21°C-SD, and that this requires PIF4 and PIF5 as well as CONSTANS (CO), a TF that promotes ﬂowering under LDs. The CO and PIF4 proteins are present at dusk under 27°C-SD, and they physically interact. Although Col-0 plants ﬂower at similar times under 27°C-SD and 21°C-LD the expression level of FT is approximately 10-fold higher under 21°C-LD, suggesting that responsiveness to FT is also increased under 27°C-SD, perhaps as a result of the reduced activity of SVP in the meristem. Accordingly, only svp41 ft-10 tsf-1 plants ﬂowered at the same time under 21°C-SD and 27°C-SD. Thus, we propose that under non-inductive SDs, elevated temperatures increase the activity and sensitize the response to the photoperiod pathway.},

	abstract = {Warm temperature promotes flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana and this response involves multiple signalling pathways. To understand the temporal dynamics of temperature perception, tests were carried out to determine if there was a daily window of enhanced sensitivity to warm temperature (28 °C). Warm temperature applied during daytime, night-time, or continuously elicited earlier flowering, but the effects of each treatment were unequal. Plants exposed to warm night (WN) conditions flowered nearly as early as those in constant warm (CW) conditions, while treatment with warm days (WD) caused later flowering than either WN or CW. Flowering in each condition relied to varying degrees on the activity of CO, FT, PIF4, and PIF5, as well as the action of unknown genes. The combination of signalling pathways involved in flowering depended on the time of the temperature cue. WN treatments caused a significant advance in the rhythmic expression waveform of CO, which correlated with pronounced up-regulation of FT expression, while WD caused limited changes in CO expression and no stimulation of FT expression. WN- and WD-induced flowering was partially CO independent and, unexpectedly, dependent on PIF4 and PIF5. pif4-2, pif5-3, and pif4-2 pif5-3 mutants had delayed flowering under all three warm conditions. The double mutant was also late flowering in control conditions. In addition, WN conditions alone imposed selective changes to PIF4 and PIF5 expression. Thus, the PIF4 and PIF5 transcription factors promote flowering by at least two means: inducing FT expression in WN and acting outside of FT by an unknown mechanism in WD.},

Induction of flowering by PIF4 is independent of CO and the photoperiod pathway.


PIF4 is strongly accumulated at the end of the night period, which is subsequently degraded during the day.


High temperature stabilizes PIF4.


PIF4 binds to the proximal region of the FT promoter. 


PIF4 binding to the FT promoter is temperature-dependent. Specifically, this is due to the affinity of PIF4 transcription factor for its binding site being temperature-dependent.


H2A.Z-nucleosomes are present at the PIF4-binding site in the FT promoter. These are rate limiting for PIF4 binding to FT (and to activate its expression).


Levels of H2A.Z-nucleosomes at this site decrease with temperature, resulting in a greater accessibility of chromatin, which allows PIF4 to bind FT more strongly.


Temperature-dependent regulation of FT by PIF4 is controlled at the level of chromatin accessibility of the FT promoter and possibly at the level of PIF4 protein activity.

Developmental processes regulating the formation of their small leaf-like structures, called fronds, and tiny ﬂowers are not well characterized. In many plant species, ﬂowering is promoted by the ﬂorigen activation complex, whose major components are ﬂorigen FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein and transcription factor FD protein. How this complex is regulated at the molecular level during duckweed ﬂowering is also not well understood. In this study, we characterized the course of developmental changes during frond development and ﬂower formation in Lemna aequinoctialis Nd, a short-day plant. Detailed observations of frond and ﬂower development revealed that cell proliferation in the early stages of frond development is active as can be seen in the separate regions corresponding to two budding pouches in the proximal region of the mother frond. L. aequinoctialis produces two stamens of different lengths with the longer stamen growing more rapidly. Using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and de novo assembly of transcripts from plants induced to ﬂower, we identiﬁed the L. aequinoctialis FT and FD genes, whose products in other angiosperms form a transcriptional complex to promote ﬂowering. We characterized the protein-protein interaction of duckweed FT and FD in yeast and examined the functions of the two gene products by overexpression in Arabidopsis. We found that L. aequinoctialis FTL1 promotes ﬂowering, whereas FTL2 suppresses ﬂowering.},

In this context, we discuss plant thermosensory responses, focusing on temperature sensing throughout vernalization in Arabidopsis. We highlight many different timescales of sensing, which has led to the proposal of a distributed thermosensing paradigm. Within this paradigm, we suggest a classification system for thermosensors. Finally, we focus on the longest timescale, which is most important for sensing winter, and examine the different mechanisms in which memory of cold exposure can be achieved.},

Plastochron is the time that passes until the younger one of two successive units or modules has reached a certain developmental status of the older one.

            Plants possess a regeneration capacity that enables them to survive after wounding. For example, detached Arabidopsis thaliana leaves are able to form adventitious roots from their cutting sites even in the absence of exogenous hormone supplements, as process termed de novo root regeneration (DNRR). Wounding rapidly induces auxin biosynthesis at the cutting sites and then elicits a signaling cascade to promote cell fate transitions and finally generate the adventitious roots. However, rooting rates in older plants are much lower than in younger leaf explants. In this review, we highlight the recent breakthroughs in the understanding of DNRR decay in older plants from at least two independent signaling routes: (i) via the accumulation of EIN3 protein in older plants, which directly suppresses expression of WUSCHEL RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) genes to inhibit rooting; (ii) the miR156-SPLs-AP2/ERFs pathway, which modulates root regeneration by reducing auxin biosynthesis.},

	abstract = {Expression of a gene is inherently random, leading to variability in a protein’s level across a population of cells with same genetic information and environment. Another consequence of this is the cell-to-cell variability in the time at which a certain protein level is achieved inside individual cells. In this work, we model such times using the ﬁrst-passage time (FPT ) framework. Gene expression is modeled in translation bursts wherein each mRNA molecule arrives as per a Poisson process, produces a geometrically distributed burst of protein molecules and degrades instantaneously. Also, the proteins are assumed to degrade as well. The FPT probability density function and statistical moments are determined for this model. In addition, the effects of change in model parameters (transcription rate, mean translation burst size, FPT threshold) on the mean and noise (quantiﬁed as the coefﬁcient of variation squared) of FPT are studied. Our analysis shows that the mean FPT increases by increasing the FPT threshold or decreasing the protein production by a lower mean burst size or a lower transcription rate. The noise properties, however, show non-trivial pattern: a U-shape behavior is seen with respect to change in mean burst size or FPT threshold whereas a monotonous trend is observed for change in transcription rate. Lastly, we also discuss how these predictions can possibly be tested via experiments on the lysis time of the bacterial virus bacteriophage λ .},

Explicit expressions for the ﬁrst two moments of the number of mRNAs and proteins at equilibrium are derived, generalizing some classical formulas.

              Polycomb and Trithorax group proteins maintain stable epigenetic memory of gene expression states for some genes, but many targets show highly dynamic regulation.

We present a mathematical model comprising a Polycomb/Trithorax response element (PRE/TRE) coupled to a promoter and including

With minimal parameter changes, the same model can also recapitulate experimental data for a different PRE/TRE that allows dynamic regulation of its target gene. The model predicts that both cell cycle length and PRE/TRE identity are critical for determining whether the system gives stable memory or dynamic regulation. Our work provides a simple unifying framework for a rich repertoire of PRE/TRE functions, and thus provides insights into  genome-wide Polycomb/Trithorax regulation.},

The rapid spread of the virus has created pandemic, and countries all over the world are struggling with a surge in COVID-19 infected cases. There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19: information on the disease is very limited and scattered even if it exists. This motivates the use of data integration, combining data from diverse sources and eliciting useful information with a unified view of them. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that integrates global data for real-time prediction of infection trajectory for multiple countries. Because the proposed model takes advantage of borrowing information across multiple countries, it outperforms an existing individual country-based model. As fully Bayesian way has been adopted, the model provides a powerful predictive tool endowed with uncertainty quantification. Additionally, a joint variable selection technique has been integrated into the proposed modeling scheme, which aimed to identify possible country-level risk factors for severe disease due to COVID-19.},

	abstract = {Circadian clocks synchronize internal processes with environmental cycles to ensure optimal timing of biological events on daily and seasonal time scales. External light and temperature cues set the core molecular oscillator to local conditions. In Arabidopsis, EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) is thought to act as an evening-specific repressor of light signals to the clock, thus serving a zeitnehmer function. Circadian rhythms were examined in completely dark-grown, or etiolated, null elf3-1 seedlings, with the clock entrained by thermocycles, to evaluate whether the elf3 mutant phenotype was light-dependent. Circadian rhythms were absent from etiolated elf3-1 seedlings after exposure to temperature cycles, and this mutant failed to exhibit classic indicators of entrainment by temperature cues, consistent with global clock dysfunction or strong perturbation of temperature signaling in this background. Warm temperature pulses failed to elicit acute induction of temperature-responsive genes in elf3-1. In fact, warm temperature-responsive genes remained in a constitutively “ON” state because of clock dysfunction and, therefore, were insensitive to temperature signals in the normal time of day-specific manner. These results show ELF3 is broadly required for circadian clock function regardless of light conditions, where ELF3 activity is needed by the core oscillator to allow progression from day to night during either light or temperature entrainment. Furthermore, robust circadian rhythms appear to be a prerequisite for etiolated seedlings to respond correctly to temperature signals.},

In this process, the expression of cold-responsive (COR) genes is activated and the genes undergo physiological changes in response to the exposure to low, non-freezing temperatures and other environmental signals. The C-repeat-binding factors (CBFs) have been demonstrated to regulate the expression of many COR genes. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms of how plants transmit cold signals from the plasma membrane to the CBFs and the results have indicated that COR genes are also regulated through CBF-independent pathways. Climate change is expected to have a major impact on cold acclimation and freezing tolerance of plants. However, how climate change affects plant cold acclimation at the molecular level remains unclear. This mini-review focuses on recent advances in cold acclimation in Arabidopsis thaliana and discusses how signaling can be potentially impacted by climate change. Understanding how plants acquire cold acclimation is valuable for the improvement of the freezing tolerance in plants and for predicting the effects of climate change on plant distribution and agricultural yield.},

To survive sub-zero winter temperatures, plants must first acclimate to low, non-freezing temperatures (cold acclimation). Induction of VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3), the first gene in the vernalization pathway, is initiated within the same time frame as the induction of genes in the cold acclimation pathway raising the question of whether there are common elements in the signal transduction pathways that activate these two responses to cold. We show that none of the signalling components required for cold acclimation, including the ‘master regulator’INDUCTION OF CBF EXPRESSION1 (ICE1) or HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENE1 (HOS1), which has been described as a link between cold acclimation and vernalization, play a role in VIN3 induction. We also show that the hormone abscisic acid (ABA) does not modulate VIN3 induction, consistent with earlier reports that ABA signalling plays no role in the vernalization response. The cold acclimation pathway is activated at 12 °C, at which temperature there is no induction of VIN3 expression. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the responses to low temperatures leading to cold acclimation and vernalization are controlled by distinct signalling pathways.},

              Because stress experiences are often recurrent plants have developed strategies to remember a first so-called priming stress to eventually respond more effectively to a second triggering stress. Here, we have studied the impact of discontinuous or sustained cold stress (4 °C) on

              grown
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              seedlings of different age and their ability to get primed and respond differently to a later triggering stress. Cold treatment of 7-d-old seedlings induced the expression of cold response genes but did not cause a significantly enhanced freezing resistance. The competence to increase the freezing resistance in response to cold was associated with the formation of true leaves. Discontinuous exposure to cold only during the night led to a stepwise modest increase in freezing tolerance provided that the intermittent phase at ambient temperature was less than 32 h. Seedlings exposed to sustained cold treatment developed a higher freezing tolerance which was further increased in response to a triggering stress during three days after the priming treatment had ended indicating cold memory. Interestingly, in all scenarios the primed state was lost as soon as the freezing tolerance had reached the level of naïve plants indicating that an effective memory was associated with an altered physiological state. Known mutants of the cold stress response (
              cbfs
              ,
              erf105
              ) and heat stress memory (

Cold acclimation has been extensively investigated and results in increased freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we show that the two Arabidopsis accessions, Col-0 and N14, which differ in their freezing tolerance, showed memory of cold acclimation, that is, cold priming. Freezing tolerance was higher in plants exposed to cold priming at 4°C, a lag phase at 20°C, and a second triggering cold stress (4°C) than in plants that were only cold primed. To our knowledge, this is the first report on cold memory improving plant freezing tolerance. The triggering response was distinguishable from the priming response at the levels of gene expression (RNA-Seq), lipid (ultraperformance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry), and metabolite composition (gas chromatography–mass spectrometry). Transcriptomic responses pointed to induced lipid, secondary metabolism, and stress in Col-0 and growth-related functions in N14. Specific accumulation of lipids included arabidopsides with possible functions as signalling molecules or precursors of jasmonic acid. Whereas cold-induced metabolites such as raffinose and its precursors were maintained in N14 during the lag phase, they were strongly accumulated in Col-0 after the cold trigger. This indicates genetic differences in the transcriptomic and metabolic patterns during cold memory.},

	abstract = {Plants re-program their gene expression when responding to changing environmental conditions. Besides differential gene expression, extensive alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNAs and changes in expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated with stress responses. RNA-sequencing of a diel time-series of the initial response of Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes to low temperature showed massive and rapid waves of both transcriptional and AS activity in protein-coding genes. We exploited the high diversity of transcript isoforms in AtRTD2 to examine regulation and post-transcriptional regulation of lncRNA gene expression in response to cold stress. We identified 135 lncRNA genes with cold-dependent differential expression (DE) and/or differential alternative splicing (DAS) of lncRNAs including natural antisense RNAs, sORF lncRNAs, and precursors of microRNAs (miRNAs) and trans-acting small-interfering RNAs (tasiRNAs). The high resolution (HR) of the time-series allowed the dynamics of changes in transcription and AS to be determined and identified early and adaptive transcriptional and AS changes in the cold response. Some lncRNA genes were regulated only at the level of AS and using plants grown at different temperatures and a HR time-course of the first 3 h of temperature reduction, we demonstrated that the AS of some lncRNAs is highly sensitive to small temperature changes suggesting tight regulation of expression. In particular, a splicing event in TAS1a which removed an intron that contained the miR173 processing and phased siRNAs generation sites was differentially alternatively spliced in response to cold. The cold-induced reduction of the spliced form of TAS1a and of the tasiRNAs suggests that splicing may enhance production of the siRNAs. Our results identify candidate lncRNAs that may contribute to the regulation of expression that determines the physiological processes essential for acclimation and freezing tolerance.},

	abstract = {Plants monitor many aspects of their fluctuating environments to help align their development with seasons. Molecular understanding of how noisy temperature cues are registered has emerged from dissection of vernalization in Arabidopsis, which involves a multiphase cold-dependent silencing of the floral repressor locus FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Cold-induced transcriptional silencing precedes a low probability PRC2 epigenetic switching mechanism. The epigenetic switch requires the absence of warm temperatures as well as long-term cold exposure. However, the natural temperature inputs into the earlier transcriptional silencing phase are less well understood. Here, through investigation of Arabidopsis accessions in natural and climatically distinct field sites, we show that the first seasonal frost strongly induces expression of COOLAIR, the antisense transcripts at FLC. Chamber experiments delivering a constant mean temperature with different fluctuations showed the freezing induction of COOLAIR correlates with stronger repression of FLC mRNA. Identification of a mutant that ectopically activates COOLAIR revealed how COOLAIR up-regulation can directly reduce FLC expression. Consistent with this, transgenes designed to knockout COOLAIR perturbed the early phase of FLC silencing. However, all transgenes designed to remove COOLAIR resulted in increased production of novel convergent FLC antisense transcripts. Our study reveals how natural temperature fluctuations promote COOLAIR regulation of FLC, with the first autumn frost acting as a key indicator of autumn/winter arrival.},

	abstract = {Entrainment, the synchronization of a circadian clock with the external environment, is a crucial step in daily life. Although many signals contribute to entrainment, light and temperature are typically the strongest resetting cues. Much progress has been made concerning light resetting in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Multiple photoreceptors (phytochromes, cryptochromes, LOV-domain proteins) are involved in light perception. The clock genes CCA1, LHY and TOC1 are all probable targets of light signalling, although the details of these pathways are not completely established. Temperature can entrain the clock, but little is known about the mechanism underlying this resetting; no obvious clock gene candidate for temperature resetting has been identified. Although circadian research has emphasized oscillations in free-running conditions, in the real world the circadian clock is entrained. During entrainment, short or long period mutants exhibit a 24-h period, but a mutant phenotype is often manifested as an altered phase relationship with the entraining cycle; short and long period mutants show leading and lagging phases, respectively, and this may be detrimental under some conditions. Arrhythmic CCA1-overexpressing plants display increased lethality under very short photoperiods, consistent with the circadian clock being of adaptive significance to life on a rotating world.},

	abstract = {As most organisms age, their appearance, physiology, and behaviour alters as part of a life history strategy that maximizes their fitness over their lifetime. The passage of time is measured by organisms and is used to modulate these age-related changes. Organisms have an endogenous time measurement system called the circadian clock. This endogenous clock regulates many physiological responses throughout the life history of organisms to enhance their fitness. However, little is known about the relation between ageing and the circadian clock in plants. Here, we investigate the association of leaf ageing with circadian rhythm changes to better understand the regulation of life-history strategy in Arabidopsis. The circadian periods of clock output genes were approximately 1 h shorter in older leaves than younger leaves. The periods of the core clock genes were also consistently shorter in older leaves, indicating an effect of ageing on regulation of the circadian period. Shortening of the circadian period with leaf age occurred faster in plants grown under a long photoperiod compared with a short photoperiod. We screened for a regulatory gene that links ageing and the circadian clock among multiple clock gene mutants. Only mutants for the clock oscillator TOC1 did not show a shortened circadian period during leaf ageing, suggesting that TOC1 may link age to changes in the circadian clock period. Our findings suggest that age-related information is incorporated into the regulation of the circadian period and that TOC1 is necessary for this integrative process.},

	abstract = {Leaf senescence is an integrated response of the cells to develop age information and various environmental signals. Thus, some of the genes involved in the response to environmental changes are expected to regulate leaf senescence. Light acts not only as the primary source of energy for photosynthesis but also as an essential environmental cue that directly control plant growth and development including leaf senescence. The molecular mechanisms linking light signaling to leaf senescence have recently emerged, exploring the role of Phytochrome-Interacting Factors (PIFs) as a central player leading to diverse senescence responses, senescence-promoting gene regulatory networks (GRNs) involving PIFs, and structural features of transcription modules in GRNs. The circadian clock is an endogenous time-keeping system for the adaptation of organisms to changing environmental signals and coordinates developmental events throughout the life of the plant. Circadian rhythms can be reset by environmental signals, such as light-dark or temperature cycles, to match the environmental cycle. Research advances have led to the discovery of the role of core clock components as senescence regulators and their underlying signaling pathways, as well as the age-dependent shortening of the circadian clock period. These discoveries highlight the close relationship between the circadian system and leaf senescence. Key issues remain to be elucidated, including the effect of light on leaf senescence in relation to the circadian clock, and the identification of key molecules linking aging, light, and the circadian clock, and integration mechanisms of various senescence-affecting signals at the multi-regulation levels in dynamics point of view.},

We discuss methods focused on a single data type, methods that integrate several omics data types, methods that integrate static and time-series data, and methods that focus on single-cell data. For each of these categories, we present some of the top methods and discuss their underlying assumptions, advantages, and potential shortcomings. As the quantity and types of time-series omics data continue to increase, we expect that these methods, and additional methods extending and improving them, would play an increasingly important role in our ability to accurately model biological processes.},

	doi = {10.1186/1752-0509-6-104},
	abstract = {Background: Modeling dynamic regulatory networks is a major challenge since much of the protein-DNA interaction data available is static. The Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM) uses a Hidden Markov Model-based approach to integrate this static interaction data with time series gene expression leading to models that can determine when transcription factors (TFs) activate genes and what genes they regulate. DREM has been used successfully in diverse areas of biological research. However, several issues were not addressed by the original version.
Results: DREM 2.0 is a comprehensive software for reconstructing dynamic regulatory networks that supports interactive graphical or batch mode. With version 2.0 a set of new features that are unique in comparison with other softwares are introduced. First, we provide static interaction data for additional species. Second, DREM 2.0 now accepts continuous binding values and we added a new method to utilize TF expression levels when searching for dynamic models. Third, we added support for discriminative motif discovery, which is particularly powerful for species with limited experimental interaction data. Finally, we improved the visualization to support the new features. Combined, these changes improve the ability of DREM 2.0 to accurately recover dynamic regulatory networks and make it much easier to use it for analyzing such networks in several species with varying degrees of interaction information.
Conclusions: DREM 2.0 provides a unique framework for constructing and visualizing dynamic regulatory networks. DREM 2.0 can be downloaded from: www.sb.cs.cmu.edu/drem.},

	abstract = {Background: In flowering plants, precise timing of the floral transition is crucial to maximize chances of reproductive success, and as such, this process has been intensively studied. FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) have been identified as closely related eukaryotic phosphatidylethanolamine-binding proteins (‘EuPEBPs’) that integrate multiple environmental stimuli, and act antagonistically to determine the optimal timing of the floral transition. Extensive research has demonstrated that FT acts similar to hormonal signals, being transported in the phloem from its primary site of expression in leaves to its primary site of action in the shoot meristem; TFL1 also appears to act as a mobile signal. Recent work implicates FT, TFL1, and the other members of the EuPEBP family, in the control of other important processes, suggesting that the EuPEBP family may be key general regulators of developmental transitions in flowering plants. In eudicots, there are a small number of EuPEBP proteins, but in monocots, and particularly grasses, there has been a large, but uncharacterized expansion of EuPEBP copy number, with unknown consequences for the EuPEBP function.
Results: To systematically characterize the evolution of EuPEBP proteins in flowering plants, and in land plants more generally, we performed a high-resolution phylogenetic analysis of 701 PEBP sequences from 208 species. We refine previous models of EuPEBP evolution in early land plants, demonstrating the algal origin of the family, and pin-pointing the origin of the FT/TFL1 clade at the base of monilophytes. We demonstrate how a core set of genes (MFT1, MFT2, FT, and TCB) at the base of flowering plants has undergone differential evolution in the major angiosperm lineages. This includes the radical expansion of the FT family in monocots into 5 core lineages, further re-duplicated in the grass family to 12 conserved clades.
Conclusions: We show that many grass FT proteins are strongly divergent from other FTs and are likely neofunctional regulators of development. Our analysis shows that monocots and eudicots have strongly divergent patterns of EuPEBP evolution.},

	abstract = {The ability to sense environmental temperature and to coordinate growth and development accordingly, is critical to the reproductive success of plants. Flowering time is regulated at the level of gene expression by a complex network of factors that integrate environmental and developmental cues. One of the main players, involved in modulating flowering time in response to changes in ambient temperature is FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM). FLM transcripts can undergo extensive alternative splicing producing multiple variants, of which FLM-β and FLM-δ are the most representative. While FLM-β codes for the flowering repressor FLM protein, translation of FLM-δ has the opposite effect on flowering. Here we show that the cyclin-dependent kinase G2 (CDKG2), together with its cognate cyclin, CYCLYN L1 (CYCL1) affects the alternative splicing of FLM, balancing the levels of FLM-β and FLM-δ across the ambient temperature range. In the absence of the CDKG2/CYCL1 complex, FLM-β expression is reduced while FLM-δ is increased in a temperature dependent manner and these changes are associated with an early flowering phenotype in the cdkg2 mutant lines. In addition, we found that transcript variants retaining the full FLM intron 1 are sequestered in the cell nucleus. Strikingly, FLM intron 1 splicing is also regulated by CDKG2/CYCL1. Our results provide evidence that temperature and CDKs regulate the alternative splicing of FLM, contributing to flowering time definition.},

Developing seedlings achieve autotrophic growth as they acquire photosynthetic competence during seedling establishment. Various developmental programs tightly regulate the heterotrophicto-autotrophic transition, which is also inﬂuenced by environmental conditions through complicated, interacting signaling pathways. Light provides the primary environmental cue that triggers the autotrophic transition, and the underlying molecular and physiological mechanisms are well understood. Other internal and external factors, such as nutrient and water availability, and temperature, contribute to ﬁne-tuning the light-mediated induction of autotrophic transition, showing the plasticity of this process, which allows developing seedlings to adapt to varying environmental conditions. In this review, we summarize recent studies on the molecular events that occur during the autotrophic transition and its adaptation to environmental constraints.

The redundant and specific roles of each member of a multimember miRNA gene family are poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that the miR156-SPL-miR172 axis constitutes a signaling cascade in regulating plant developmental transitions. Here, we report the feasibility and utility of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to investigate the functions of all 5

              family members exhibit distinct expression pattern and exert functional specificity in regulating meristem size, trichome initiation, stem elongation, shoot branching, and floral competence. In particular, we find that the miR156-SPL-miR172 cascade is bifurcated into specific flowering responses by matching pairs of coexpressed

	abstract = {Ambient temperature fluctuates diurnally and seasonally. It profoundly influences the timing of flowering in plants. The floral integrator FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) mediates ambient temperature signals via the thermosensory pathway in Arabidopsis flowering. microRNA172 (miR172), which promotes flowering by inducing FT, also responds to changes in ambient temperature. However, it is largely unknown how miR172 integrates ambient temperature signals into the flowering genetic network. Here, we show that Arabidopsis RNA-binding protein FCA promotes the processing of primary microRNA172 transcripts (pri-miR172) in response to changes in ambient temperature. Ambient temperature regulates miR172 biogenesis primarily at the pri-miR172 processing step. miR172 abundance is elevated at 23 °C but not at 16 °C. miR172 accumulation at 23 °C requires functional FCA. FCA binds to the flanking sequences of the stem-loop within the pri-miR172 transcripts via the RNA recognition motif. FCA also binds to the primary transcripts of other temperature-responsive miRNAs, such as miR398 and miR399. Notably, levels of FCA mRNAs and proteins increase at 23 °C but remain low at 16 °C, supporting the role of FCA in temperature perception. Our data show that FCA regulation of miR172 processing is an early event in the thermosensory flowering pathway. We propose that the FCA-miR172 regulon provides an adaptive strategy that fine tunes the onset of flowering under fluctuating ambient temperature conditions.},

In this study, to elucidate the mechanism of flowering-time regulation by small RNAs, we identified six ambient temperature-responsive miRNAs (miR156, miR163, miR169, miR172, miR398 and miR399) in Arabidopsis via miRNA microarray and northern hybridization analyses. We also determined the expression profile of 120 unique miRNA loci in response to ambient temperature changes by miRNA northern hybridization analysis. The expression of the ambient temperature-responsive miRNAs and their target genes was largely anticorrelated at two different temperatures (16 and 23°C). Interestingly, a lesion in short vegetative phase (SVP), a key regulator within the thermosensory pathway, caused alteration in the expression of miR172 and a subset of its target genes, providing a link between a thermosensory pathway gene and miR172. The miR172-overexpressing plants showed a temperature-independent early flowering phenotype, suggesting that modulation of miR172 expression leads to temperature insensitivity. Taken together, our results suggest a genetic framework for flowering-time regulation by ambient temperature-responsive miRNAs under non-stress temperature conditions.},

An Arabidopsis ice1 mutant was isolated in a screen for mutations that impair cold-induced transcription of a CBF3 promoter-luciferase reporter gene. The ice1 mutation blocks the expression of CBF3 and decreases the expression of many genes downstream of CBFs, which leads to a significant reduction in plant chilling and freezing tolerance. ICE1 encodes a MYC-like bHLH transcriptional activator. ICE1 binds specifically to the MYC recognition sequences in the CBF3 promoter.

The general increase of enzyme activities and metabolites emphasized the positive and compensatory nature of this response.},

	abstract = {The cold-responsive (COR) genes play an important role in cold acclimation of higher plants. Here, a tight correlation between chloroplast functionality and COR15A expression, and the functional characterization of Arabidopsis COR15A involved in salt/osmotic stress, were revealed. COR15A gene is light inducible and expressed in light-grown seedlings. The expression level of COR15A was reduced when chloroplasts were damaged by norﬂurazon treatment. By using several albino mutants, seca1, secy1, and tic20, all of which exhibited severe defects in both structure and function of chloroplast, it was shown that the accumulation of COR15A mRNA depends on chloroplast functionality. Real-time RT-PCR and GUSstaining assays demonstrated that COR15A was induced by salt/osmotic stress partially via ABA. Overexpression of COR15A in Arabidopsis resulted in the seedlings displaying hypersensitivity to salt/osmotic stress. All these results suggest that plant acquire the ability to fully express COR15A only after the development of functional chloroplasts, COR15A may be involved in response to salt/ osmotic stress during early stages of plant development.},

Further, histochemical staining experiments indicated that this cold-regulatory element(s) was active at low temperature throughout much of the plant including leaves, stems, roots, flower petals, filaments, and sepals. Time-course experiments indicated that the activity of the cor78 promoter in cold-acclimated plants was down-regulated quickly in response to noninducing temperatures and that the half-life of the cor78 transcripts was only about 40 min at normal growth temperature. Fusion of the entire transcribed region of cor78 to the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter resulted in a chimeric gene that was constitutively expressed and displayed little if any posttranscriptional regulation in response to low temperature.},

	abstract = {A test was carried out to see if sucrose could regulate cold-acclimation-associated gene expression in Arabidopsis. In plants and excised leaves, sucrose caused an increase in GUS activity, as a reporter for the activity of the cold-responsive COR78 promoter. This increase was transient at 21 °C but lasted for at least 4 d at 4 °C in continuous darkness. However, at 4 °C with a 16 h photoperiod, GUS activity was similarly high with solutions lacking sucrose or with different concentrations of sucrose. In peeled lower epidermis in the cold dark environment, 40 mM sucrose increased COR78 transcript abundance to substantially above that in the controls, but sorbitol had no effect. Similarly to the cold and dark conditions, sucrose increased COR78 transcript abundance in the epidermis in the warm light and warm dark environments, but not in a cold light environment. Sucrose had much less effect on COR78 transcript abundance in leaves without the lower epidermis. Thus sucrose regulates expression of COR78, possibly mainly in the epidermis, at the level of transcription. Furthermore, 40 mM sucrose at 4 °C for 24 h in constant darkness was sufﬁcient to give the same GUS activity as in fully acclimated plants of the same age in a 16 h photoperiod, although by 48 h, GUS activity had become intermediate between control and fully cold-acclimated plants. Thus sucrose has a regulatory role in the acclimation of whole plants to cold and this may be important during diurnal dark periods.},

	abstract = {Duckweeds (Lemnaceae family) are the smallest ﬂowering plants that adapt to the aquatic environment. They are regarded as the promising sustainable feedstock with the characteristics of high starch storage, fast propagation, and global distribution. The duckweed genome size varies 13-fold ranging from 150 Mb in Spirodela polyrhiza to 1,881 Mb in Wolfﬁa arrhiza. With the development of sequencing technology and bioinformatics, ﬁve duckweed genomes from Spirodela and Lemna genera are sequenced and assembled. The genome annotations discover that they share similar protein orthologs, whereas the repeat contents could mainly explain the genome size difference. The gene families responsible for cell growth and expansion, lignin biosynthesis, and ﬂowering are greatly contracted. However, the gene family of glutamate synthase has experienced expansion, indicating their signiﬁcance in ammonia assimilation and nitrogen transport. The transcriptome is comprehensively sequenced for the genera of Spirodela, Landoltia, and Lemna, including various treatments such as abscisic acid, radiation, heavy metal, and starvation. The analysis of the underlying molecular mechanism and the regulatory network would accelerate their applications in the ﬁelds of bioenergy and phytoremediation. The comparative genomics has shown that duckweed genomes contain relatively low gene numbers and more contracted gene families, which may be in parallel with their highly reduced morphology with a simple leaf and primary roots. Still, we are waiting for the advancement of the long read sequencing technology to resolve the complex genomes and transcriptomes for unsequenced Wolfﬁella and Wolfﬁa due to the large genome sizes and the similarity in their polyploidy.},

	abstract = {Background:  Plants are easily affected by temperature variations, and high temperature (heat stress) and low temperature (cold stress) will lead to poor plant development and reduce crop yields. Therefore, it is very important to identify resistance genes for improving the ability of plants to resist heat stress or cold stress by using modern biotechnology. Members of the C-repeat binding factor/Dehydration responsive element-binding 1 (CBF/DREB1) protein family are related to the stress resistance of many plant species. These proteins affect the growth and development of plants and play vital roles during environmental stress (cold, heat, drought, salt, etc.). In this study, we identified CBF/ DREB1 genes from 43 plant species (including algae, moss, ferns, gymnosperms, angiosperms) by using bioinformatic methods to clarify the characteristics of the CBF/DREB1 protein family members and their functions in potato under heat and cold stresses. Results:  In this study, we identified 292 CBF/DREB1 proteins from 43 plant species. However, no CBF/DREB1 protein was found in algae, moss, ferns, or gymnosperms; members of this protein family exist only in angiosperms. Phylogenetic analysis of all the CBF/DREB1 proteins revealed five independent groups. Among them, the genes of group I do not exist in eudicots and are found only in monocots, indicating that these genes have a special effect on monocots. The analysis of motifs, gene duplication events, and the expression data from the PGSC website revealed the gene structures, evolutionary relationships, and expression patterns of the CBF/DREB1 proteins. In addition, analysis of the transcript levels of the 8 CBF/DREB1 genes in potato (Solanum tuberosum) under low-temperature and high-temperature stresses showed that these genes were related to temperature stresses. In particular, the expression levels of StCBF3 and StCBF4 in the leaves, stems, and roots significantly increased under high-temperature conditions, which suggested that StCBF3 and StCBF4 may be closely related to heat tolerance in potato.},

	abstract = {The application potential of four duckweed strains from four genera, Wolfﬁa globosa 0222, Lemna japonica 0223, Landoltia punctata 0224 and Spirodela polyrhiza 0225, were compared in four parallel pilot-scale wastewater treatment systems for more than 1 year. The results indicated that each duckweed strain had unique potential advantages. Unlike L. japonica 0223 and La. punctata 0224, which grow throughout the year, S. polyrhiza 0225 and W. globosa 0222 do not survive cold weather. For year round performance, L. japonica 0223 was best not only in dry biomass production (6.10 gÁmÀ2ÁdayÀ1), but also in crude protein (35.50\%), total amino acid (26.83\%) and phosphorus (1.38\%) content, plus recovery rates of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and CO2 (0.31, 0.085 and 7.76 gÁmÀ2ÁdayÀ1, respectively) and removal rates of TN and TP (0.66 and 0.089 gÁmÀ2ÁdayÀ1, respectively). This strongly demonstrates that L. japonica 0223 performed best in wastewater treatment and protein biomass production. Under nutrient starvation conditions, La. punctata 0224 had the highest starch content (45.84\%), dry biomass production (4.81 gÁmÀ2ÁdayÀ1) and starch accumulation (2.9 gÁmÀ2ÁdayÀ1), making it best for starch biomass production. W. globosa 0222 and S. polyrhiza 0225 showed increased ﬂavonoid biomass production, with higher total ﬂavonoid content (5.85\% and 4.22\%, respectively) and high dominant ﬂavonoids ({\textgreater}60\%). This study provides useful information for selecting the appropriate local duckweed strains for further application in wastewater treatment and valuable biomass production.},

This transition is a result of responses to various endogenous and exogenous signals that later integrate to result in flowering. Five genetically defined pathways have been identified that control flowering. The vernalization pathway refers to the acceleration of flowering on exposure to a long period of cold. The photoperiod pathway refers to regulation of flowering in response to day length and quality of light perceived. The gibberellin pathway refers to the requirement of gibberellic acid for normal flowering patterns. The autonomous pathway refers to endogenous regulators that are independent of the photoperiod and gibberellin pathways. Most recently, an endogenous pathway that adds plant age to the control of flowering time has been described. The molecular mechanisms of these pathways have been studied extensively in Arabidopsis thaliana and several other flowering plants.},

	abstract = {Plants have become physiologically adapted to a seasonally shifting environment by evolving many sensory mechanisms. Seasonal flowering is a good example of adaptation to local environmental demands and is crucial for maximizing reproductive fitness. Photoperiod and temperature are major environmental stimuli that control flowering through expression of a floral inducer, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein. Recent discoveries made using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have shown that the functions of photoreceptors are essential for the timing of FT gene induction, via modulation of the transcriptional activator CONSTANS (CO) at transcriptional and posttranslational levels in response to seasonal variations. The activation of FT transcription by the fine-tuned CO protein enables plants to switch from vegetative growth to flowering under inductive environmental conditions. The present review briefly summarizes our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which the information of environmental stimuli is sensed and transduced to trigger FT induction in leaves.},

Sarantena was characterized as lower values of average T as compared to Evinos River. ‘End of flowering’ appeared later in Evinos River compared to Sarantena. The earliest and latest onset of ‘End of flowering’ took place in 2011 and 2012, respectively, for both examined areas. The ‘End of flowering’ onset correlated positively with the average T of October. The increase of 1 °C caused a delay of the onset of the examined phenophase by 8.49 and 5.70 julian days in Evinos River and Sarantena, respectively. The results of this study may contribute to planning of an effective control program of C. arvense.},

Bread wheat line ‘Paragon’, introgressed with single or multiple daylength insensitivity alleles was used to dissect the effects on the timing and duration of flowering within a hierarchical plant architecture. Flowering of wheat plants was observed in a series of pot-based and field experiments. Ppd-D1a was the most potent known allele affecting the timing of flowering, requiring the least thermal time to flowering across all experiments. The duration of flowering for individual lines was dominated by the shift in the start of flowering in later tillers and the number of tillers per plant, rather than variation in flowering duration of individual spikes. There was a strong relationship between flowering duration and the start of flowering with the earliest lines flowering for the longest. The greatest flowering overlap between tillers was recorded for the Ppd-1b. Across all lines, a warmer environment significantly reduced the duration of flowering and the influence of Ppd-1a alleles on the start of flowering. These findings provide evidence of pleiotropic effects of the Ppd-1a alleles, and have direct implications for breeding for increased stress resilient wheat varieties.},

Seed yield was unrelated to time or duration of flowering, but positively correlated with rate of inflorescence production, total inflorescence, burr and seed numbers, number of seeds per burr, and seed size. Rate of inflorescence production was the main determinant of total inflorescence numbers per unit area and an important determinant of total burr and seed numbers per unit area. It was negatively related to flowering duration, and weakly so to seed size. Seed size was unrelated to strain maturity. Seeds of small-seeded and fast-flowering strains on average attained viability faster than those of large-seeded and slow-flowering strains. Number of seeds per burr increased slightly with lateness of flowering, but was unrelated to seed size or flowering rate.

Here, we investigated the relationship between flowering phenology, abiotic factors, and plant functional attributes, while controlling for phylogenetic relationship among species, in a dry forest community in Mexico. METHODS: We characterized flowering phenology (time and duration) and pollination syndromes of 55 tree species, 49 herbs, 24 shrubs, 15 lianas, and 11 vines. We tested the influence of pollination syndrome, growth form, and abiotic factors on flowering phenology using phylogenetic generalized least squares. KEY RESULTS: We found a relationship between flowering duration and time. Growth form was related to flowering time, and the pollination syndrome had a more significant relationship with flowering duration. Flowering time variation in the community was explained mainly by abiotic variables, without an important phylogenetic effect. Flowering time in lianas and trees was negatively and positively correlated with daylength, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Functional attributes, environmental cues, and phylogeny interact with each other to shape the diversity of flowering patterns. Phenological differentiation among species groups revealed multiples strategies associated with growth form and pollination syndromes that can be important for understanding species coexistence in this highly diverse plant community.},

	abstract = {There is an increasing potential to incorporate recent advances in our understanding of molecular-genetic pathways of flowering-time regulation to forecast shifts in flowering phenology in response to rising temperature. Recent studies developed models that integrate temperature and photoperiod signals into the network of floral regulatory genes, and predicted the shortening of flowering duration under warming based on the expression dynamics of major flowering-time genes in the perennial herb Arabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera. Nevertheless, empirical testing of the model prediction is still lacking. We performed temperature manipulation experiments and common garden experiments to test the model predictions using plants from two distant populations of A. halleri. We also quantified expression levels of two major flowering-time genes and compared the observed and predicted gene expression patterns. Our experiments in the laboratory and the field demonstrated that flowering duration of A. halleri was significantly shortened under warming conditions. Our results also revealed that the end of flowering was more sensitive to the climate warming than the onset of flowering in A. halleri. The observed gene expression dynamics in the warming condition were predicted well by the gene regulatory model. The transplant experiment of plants from Hokkaido, the northernmost island, to the subtropical field site in Okinawa, Japan, showed that plants flowered without significant activation of FLOWERING LOCUS T, a floral integrator crucial for the accelerated flowering in long days. The study suggested that the redundancy of flowering gene regulatory network could be beneficial to the persistence of flowering ability under extreme climatic conditions.},

	abstract = {Monogenic mutants of the early ecotype Landsberg erecta were selected on the basis of late flowering under long day (LD) conditions after treatment with ethyl methanesulphonate or irradiation. In addition to later flowering the number of rosette and cauline leaves is proportionally higher in all mutants, although the correlation coefficient between the two parameters is not the same for all genotypes. Forty-two independently induced mutants were found to represent mutations at 11 loci. The mutations were either recessive, intermediate (co locus) or almost completely dominant (fwa locus). The loci are located at distinct positions on four of the five Arabidopsis chromosomes. Recombinants carrying mutations at different loci flower later than or as late as the later parental mutant. This distinction led to the assignment of eight of the loci to three epistatic groups. In wild type, vernalization promotes flowering to a small extent. For mutants at the loci fca, fve, fy and fpa, vernalization has a large effect both under LD and short day (SD) conditions, whereas co, gi, fd and fwa mutants are almost completely insensitive to this treatment. SD induces later flowering except for mutants at the co and gi loci, which flower with the same number of leaves under LD and SD conditions. This differential response of the mutants to environmental factors and their subdivision into epistatic groups is discussed in relation to a causal model for floral initiation in Arabidopsis thaliana.},

Each floral meristem differentiates into a flower consisting of four organ types that occupy precisely defined positions within four concentric whorls. Genetic studies in Arabidopsis thaliana and Antirrhinum majus have identified early-acting genes that determine the identity of the floral meristem, and late-acting genes that determine floral organ identity1–5. In Arabidopsis, at least two genes, APETALA1 and LEAFY, are required for the transition of an inflorescence meristem into a floral meristem1. We have cloned the APETALA1 gene and here we show that it encodes a putative transcription factor that contains a MADS-domain2. APETALA1 RNA is uniformly expressed in young flower primordia, and later becomes localized to sepals and petals. Our results suggest that APETALA1 acts locally to specify the identity of the floral meristem, and to determine sepal and petal development.},

Using this terminology, the apical meristem of Arabidopsis produces three metameric types sequentially: type 1, rosette; type 2, coflorescence-bearing with bract; and type 3, flower-bearing without bract. We describe a mutant of Arabidopsis, Leafy, homozygous for a recessive allele of a nuclear gene LEAFY (LFY), that has an inflorescence composed only of type 2-like metamers. These data suggest that the LFY gene is required for the development of type 3 metamers and that the transition from type 2 to type 3 metamers is a developmental step distinct from that between vegetative and reproductive growth (type 1 to type 2 metamers). Results from double mutant analysis, showing that lfy-1 is epistatic to the floral organ homeotic gene ap2-6, are consistent with the hypothesis that a functional LFY gene is necessary for the expression of downstream genes controlling floral organ identity.},

In the present study, this method was evaluated and a substantially modified transformation method was developed. The labor-intensive vacuum infiltration process was eliminated in favor of simple dipping of developing floral tissues into a solution containing Agrobacterium tumefaciens , 5\% sucrose and 500 microliters per litre of surfactant Silwet L-77. Sucrose and surfactant were critical to the success of the floral dip method. Plants inoculated when numerous immature floral buds and few siliques were present produced transformed progeny at the highest rate. Plant tissue culture media, the hormone benzylamino purine and pH adjustment were unnecessary, and Agrobacterium could be applied to plants at a range of cell densities. Repeated application of Agrobacterium improved transformation rates and overall yield of transformants approximately twofold. Covering plants for 1 day to retain humidity after inoculation also raised transformation rates twofold. Multiple ecotypes were transformable by this method. The modified method should facilitate high-throughput transformation of Arabidopsis for efforts such as T-DNA gene tagging, positional cloning, or attempts at targeted gene replacement.},

Plants have evolved various strategies to prepare for, and adapt to environmental changes. Plants integrate environmental cues with endogenous signals to regulate various physiological processes, including flowering time. There are at least five distinct pathways controlling flowering in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana: the photoperiod pathway, the vernalization/thermosensory pathway, the autonomous floral initiation, the gibberellins pathway, and the age pathway. The photoperiod and temperature/ vernalization pathways mainly perceive external signals from the environment, while the autonomous and age pathways transmit endogenous cues within plants. In many plant species, floral transition is precisely controlled by light signals (photoperiod) and temperature to optimize seed production in specific environments. The molecular mechanisms by which light and temperature control flowering responses have been revealed using forward and reverse genetic approaches. Here we focus on the recent advances in research on flowering responses to light and temperature.},

	abstract = {Auxins, cytokinins and strigolactones are three classes of hormones that regulate bud activation and thereby regulate shoot branching. These hormones are transported throughout the plant, forming a systemic network that allows the integration of information between different plant organs and with the environment.The identification and characterization in various plant species of a class of highly branching mutants that lack, or are impaired in the perception of, the acropetally transported hormones known as strigolactones was central to recent progress in understanding the mechanisms of shoot branching control.One model for bud activation is based on the auxin transport canalization-based model, which stipulates that an initial flux from an auxin source to an auxin sink is gradually canalized into files of cells with high levels of highly polarized transporters. The process of canalization is driven by a positive feedback loop in which auxin flux upregulates and polarizes auxin efflux facilitators in the direction of the auxin flow, resulting in the formation of auxin transport canals.In the auxin transport canalization-based model for bud activation, buds are considered as auxin sources, and the stem acts as an auxin sink owing to its ability to transport auxin away to the root. Buds must export auxin to be activated, and upon bud activation, auxin transport from active buds reduces the sink strength of the stem, and thus prevents other buds from exporting their auxin.According to an alternative model for bud activation, known as the second messenger model, auxin derived from the shoot apex inhibits bud outgrowth by regulating the production of a second messenger, which moves directly into the bud to control its activity. Cytokinins and strigolactones are two candidate hormones to serve as second messengers.Environmental inputs, such as altered light quality or nutrient deficiency in the soil, affect shoot branching using a network of interacting hormones including auxin, cytokinins and strigolactones. The detailed molecular mechanisms of the integration of the environmental signals into the system remain to be unravelled.},

Grafting experiments established unequivocal one-to-one relations between SINGLE FLOWER TRUSS (SFT), a tomato homolog of FT, and the hypothetical florigen, in all flowering plants. Additional studies of SFT and SELF PRUNING (SP, homolog of TFL1), two antagonistic genes regulating the architecture of the sympodial shoot system, have suggested that transition to flowering in the day-neutral and perennial tomato is synonymous with “termination.” Dosage manipulation of its endogenous and mobile, graft-transmissible levels demonstrated that florigen regulates termination and transition to flowering in an SP-dependent manner and, by the same token, that high florigen levels induce growth arrest and termination in meristems across the tomato shoot system. It was thus proposed that growth balances, and consequently the patterning of the shoot systems in all plants, are mediated by endogenous, meristem-specific dynamic SFT/SP ratios and that shifts to termination by changing SFT/SP ratios are triggered by the imported florigen, the mobile form of SFT. Florigen is a universal plant growth hormone inherently checked by a complementary antagonistic systemic system. Thus, an examination of the endogenous functions of FT-like genes, or of the systemic roles of the mobile florigen in any plant species, that fails to pay careful attention to the balancing antagonistic systems, or to consider its functions in day-neutral or perennial plants, would be incomplete.},

However, their exact functions in the cold response remains unclear due to the lack of a null cbf triple mutant. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to mutate CBF1 or CBF1/CBF2 in a cbf3 T-DNA insertion mutant to generate cbf1,3 double and cbf1 cbf2 cbf3 (cbfs) triple mutants. The response of the cbfs triple mutants to chilling stress is impaired. Furthermore, no significant difference in freezing tolerance was observed between the wild-type and the cbf1,3 and cbfs mutants without cold acclimation. However, the cbfs mutants were extremely sensitive to freezing stress after cold acclimation, and freezing sensitivity ranking was cbfs {\textgreater} cbf1,3 {\textgreater} cbf3. RNA-Seq analysis showed that 134 genes were CBF regulated, of which 112 were regulated positively and 22 negatively by CBFs. Our study reveals the essential functions of CBFs in chilling stress response and cold acclimation, as well as defines a set of genes as CBF regulon. It also provides materials for the genetic dissection of components in CBF-dependent cold signaling.},

Seedlings grown in the light develop photomorphogenically, characterized by short hypocotyls and expanded green cotyledons. In contrast, seedlings grown in darkness become etiolated, with elongated hypocotyls and closed cotyledons on an apical hook. Light signals, perceived by multiple photoreceptors and transduced to downstream regulators, dictate the extent of photomorphogenic development in a quantitative manner. Two key downstream components, COP1 and HY5, act antagonistically in regulating seedling development1. HY5 is a bZIP transcription factor that binds directly to the promoters of light-inducible genes, promoting their expression and photomorphogenic development2,3. COP1 is a RING-finger protein with WD-40 repeats whose nuclear abundance is negatively regulated by light4,5. COP1 interacts directly with HY5 in the nucleus to regulate its activity negatively1. Here we show that the abundance of HY5 is directly correlated with the extent of photomorphogenic development, and that the COP1–HY5 interaction may specifically target HY5 for proteasome-mediated degradation in the nucleus.},

Plants use temperature signals to measure time of year, and changes to life histories are therefore an important consequence of climate change. Here we show that in Arabidopsis the current and prior temperature experience of the mother plant is used to control germination of progeny seeds, via the activation of the florigen Flowering Locus T (FT) in fruit tissues. We demonstrate that maternal past and current temperature experience are transduced to the FT locus in silique phloem. In turn, FT controls seed dormancy through inhibition of proanthocyanidin synthesis in fruits, resulting in altered seed coat tannin content. Our data reveal that maternal temperature history is integrated through FT in the fruit to generate a metabolic signal that entrains the behavior of progeny seeds according to time of year.},

	abstract = {Monocarpic plants have a single reproductive phase, in which their longevity is developmentally programmed by molecular networks. In the reproductive phase of Arabidopsis thaliana, the inflorescence meristem (IM) maintains a central pool of stem cells and produces a limited number of flower primordia, which result in seed formation and the death of the whole plant. In this study, we observed morphological changes in the IM at cellular and intracellular resolutions until the end of the plant life cycle. We observed four biological events during the periods from 1 week after bolting (WAB) till the death of stem cells: (1) the gradual reduction in the size of the IM, (2) the dynamic vacuolation of IM cells, (3) the loss of the expression of the stem cell determinant WUSCHEL (WUS), and (4) the upregulation of the programmed cell death marker BIFUNCTIONAL NUCLEASE1 (BFN1) in association with the death of stem cells. These results indicate that the stem cell population gradually decreases in IM during plant aging and eventually is fully terminated. We further show that the expression of WUS became undetectable in IM at 3 WAB prior to the loss of CLAVATA3 (CLV3) expression at 5 WAB; CLV3 is a negative regulator of WUS. Moreover, clv3 plants showed delayed loss of WUS and lived 6 weeks longer compared with wild-type plants. These results indicated that the prolonged expression of CLV3 at 4–5 WAB may be a safeguard that inhibits the reactivation of WUS and promotes plant death. Finally, through transcriptome analysis, we determined that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the control of plant longevity. Our work presents a morphological and physiological framework for the regulation of plant longevity in Arabidopsis.},

	abstract = {We assessed mechanistic temperature influence on flowering by incorporating temperature-responsive flowering mechanisms across developmental age into an existing model. Temperature influences the leaf production rate as well as expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), a photoperiodic flowering regulator that is expressed in leaves. The Arabidopsis Framework Model incorporated temperature influence on leaf growth but ignored the consequences of leaf growth on and direct temperature influence of FT expression. We measured FT production in differently aged leaves and modified the model, adding mechanistic temperature influence on FT transcription, and causing whole-plant FT to accumulate with leaf growth. Our simulations suggest that in long days, the developmental stage (leaf number) at which the reproductive transition occurs is influenced by day length and temperature through FT, while temperature influences the rate of leaf production and the time (in days) the transition occurs. Further, we demonstrate that FT is mainly produced in the first 10 leaves in the Columbia (Col-0) accession, and that FT accumulation alone cannot explain flowering in conditions in which flowering is delayed. Our simulations supported our hypotheses that: 1) temperature regulation of FT, accumulated with leaf growth, is a component of thermal time, and 2) incorporating mechanistic temperature regulation of FT can improve model predictions when temperatures change over time.},

	abstract = {Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins form a cellular memory by maintaining developmental regulators in a transcriptionally repressed state. We identified a novel flowering gene that is under PcG control in Arabidopsis--the MADS-box gene AGL19. AGL19 expression is maintained at very low levels by the PcG proteins MSI1, CLF, and EMF2, and AGL19 is partly responsible for the early flowering phenotype of clf mutants. AGL19 chromatin is strongly enriched in trimethylation of Lys 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) but not in H3K9me2. Repressive H3K27me3 marks were reduced by decreased CLF or MSI1 levels and by prolonged cold, suggesting that the PcG proteins MSI1 and CLF repress AGL19 in the absence of cold. Ectopic expression of AGL19 strongly accelerates flowering, and agl19 mutants have a decreased response to vernalization, the promotion of flowering by prolonged cold. Epistasis analyses revealed that AGL19 works in the poorly characterized FLC-independent vernalization pathway and does not require SOC1 to function. In this pathway, prolonged cold relieves AGL19 from PcG repression by a mechanism that requires VIN3 but not VRN2. Elevated AGL19 levels activate LFY and AP1 and eventually cause flowering.},

In addition to later flowering the number of rosette and cauline leaves is proportionally higher in all mutants, although the correlation coefficient between the two parameters is not the same for all genotypes. Forty-two independently induced mutants were found to represent mutations at 11 loci. The mutations were either recessive, intermediate (co locus) or almost completely dominant (fwa locus). The loci are located at distinct positions on four of the five Arabidopsis chromosomes. Recombinants carrying mutations at different loci flower later than or as late as the later parental mutant. This distinction led to the assignment of eight of the loci to three epistatic groups. In wild type, vernalization promotes flowering to a small extent. For mutants at the loci fca, fve, fy and fpa, vernalization has a large effect both under LD and short day (SD) conditions, whereas co, gi, fd and fwa mutants are almost completely insensitive to this treatment. SD induces later flowering except for mutants at the co and gi loci, which flower with the same number of leaves under LD and SD conditions. This differential response of the mutants to environmental factors and their subdivision into epistatic groups is discussed in relation to a causal model for floral initiation in Arabidopsis thaliana.},

FT and SOC1 have been proposed to act in parallel pathways downstream of CO based on genetic analysis using weak ft alleles, since ft soc1 double mutants showed an additive effect in suppressing the early flowering of CO overexpressor plants. However, this genetic analysis was inconsistent with the sequential induction pattern of FT and SOC1 found in inducible CO overexpressor plants. Hence, to identify genetic interactions of CO, FT, and SOC1, we carried out genetic and expression analyses with a newly isolated T-DNA allele of FT, ft-10. We found that ft-10 almost completely suppressed the early flowering phenotype of CO overexpressor plants, whereas soc1-2 partially suppressed the phenotype, suggesting that FT is the major output of CO. Expression of SOC1 was altered in gain- or loss-of-function mutants of FT, whereas expression of FT remained unchanged in gain- or loss-of-function mutants of SOC1, suggesting that FT positively regulates SOC1 to promote flowering. In addition, inactivation of FT caused down-regulation of SOC1 even in plants overexpressing CO, indicating that FT is required for SOC1 induction by CO. Taken together, these data suggest that CO activates SOC1 through FT to promote flowering in Arabidopsis.},

Their tiny size, rapid growth by clonal propagation, and facile uptake of labeled compounds from the media were attractive features that made them a well-known model for plant biology from 1950 to 1990. Interest in duckweed has steadily regained momentum over the past decade, driven in part by the growing need to identify alternative plants from traditional agricultural crops that can help tackle urgent societal challenges, such as climate change and rapid population expansion. Propelled by rapid advances in genomic technologies, recent studies with duckweed again highlight the potential of these small plants to enable discoveries in diverse fields from ecology to chronobiology. Building on established community resources, duckweed is reemerging as a platform to study plant processes at the systems level and to translate knowledge gained for field deployment to address some of society’s pressing needs. This review details the anatomy, development, physiology, and molecular characteristics of the Lemnaceae to introduce them to the broader plant research community. We highlight recent research enabled by Lemnaceae to demonstrate how these plants can be used for quantitative studies of complex processes and for revealing potentially novel strategies in plant defense and genome maintenance., The characteristics of the Lemnaceae are introduced to the plant biology community, and recent studies are described showing how duckweed represents an ideal model for systems-level investigations.},

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we characterize the physiological and molecular effects of correlative inhibition by seeds on Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) inflorescences, i.e. global proliferative arrest (GPA) during which all maternal growth ceases upon the production of a given number of seeds. We observed transcriptional responses to growth- and branching-inhibitory hormones, and low mitotic activity in meristems upon GPA, but found that meristems retain their identity and proliferative potential. In shoot tissues, we detected the induction of stress- and senescence-related gene expression upon fruit production and GPA, and a drop in chlorophyll levels, suggestive of altered source-sink relationships between vegetative shoot and reproductive tissues. Levels of shoot reactive oxygen species, however, strongly decreased upon GPA, a phenomenon that is associated with bud dormancy in some perennials. Indeed, gene expression changes in arrested apical inflorescences after fruit removal resembled changes observed in axillary buds following release from apical dominance. This suggests that GPA represents a form of bud dormancy, and that dominance is gradually transferred from growing inflorescences to maturing seeds, allowing offspring control over maternal resources, simultaneously restricting offspring number. This would provide a mechanistic explanation for the constraint between offspring quality and quantity.},

In Arabidopsis thaliana, three dehydration-responsive element (DRE) binding protein 1/C-repeat binding factors (DREB1/CBFs) act as master switches in cold-responsive gene expression. Induction of DREB1 genes triggers the cold stress-inducible transcriptional cascade, followed by the induction of numerous genes that function in the cold stress response and cold tolerance. Many regulatory factors involved in DREB1 induction have been identified, but how these factors orchestrate the cold stress-specific expression of DREB1s has not yet been clarified. Here, we revealed that plants recognize cold stress as two different signals, rapid and gradual temperature decreases, and induce expression of the DREB1 genes. CALMODULIN BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATOR3 (CAMTA3) and CAMTA5 respond to a rapid decrease in temperature and induce the expression of DREB1s, but these proteins do not respond to a gradual decrease in temperature. Moreover, they function during the day and night, in contrast to some key circadian components, including CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL, which regulate cold-responsive DREB1 expression as transcriptional activators only during the day. Thus, plants efficiently control the acquisition of freezing tolerance using two different signaling pathways in response to a gradual temperature decrease during seasonal changes and a sudden temperature drop during the night.},

            Although many studies on plant growth and development focus on the effects of light, a growing number of studies dissect plant responses to temperature and the underlying signaling pathways. The identity of plant thermosensing molecules (thermosensors) acting upstream of the signaling cascades in temperature responses was elusive until recently. During the past six years, a set of plant thermosensors has been discovered, representing a major turning point in the research on plant temperature responses and signaling. Here, we review these newly discovered plant thermosensors, which can be classified as sensors of warmth or cold. We compare between plant thermosensors and those from other organisms and attempt to define the subcellular thermosensing compartments in plants. In addition, we discuss the notion that photoreceptive thermosensors represent a novel class of thermosensors, the roles of which have yet to be described in non-plant systems.},

We conducted a comparative analysis of the circadian properties of closely related duckweed species.

We measured bioluminescence circadian rhythms of eight species of the genus Lemna and seven species of the genus Wolffiella at various temperatures (20, 25, and 30°C) and light conditions (constant light or constant dark). Wolffiella species inhabit relatively warm areas and lack some tissues/organs found in Lemna species. Lemna species tended to show robust bioluminescence circadian rhythms under all conditions, while Wolffiella species showed lower rhythm stability, especially at higher temperatures. For Lemna, two species (L. valdiviana and L. minuta) forming a clade showed relatively lower circadian stability. For Wolffiella, two species (W. hyalina and W. repanda) forming a clade showed extremely long period lengths. These analyses reveal that the circadian properties of species primarily reflect their phylogenetic positions.

	abstract = {Environmentally induced DNA methylation variants may mediate gene expression responses to environmental changes. If such induced variants are transgenerationally stable, there is potential for expression responses to persist over multiple generations. Our current knowledge in plants, however, is almost exclusively based on studies conducted in sexually reproducing species where the majority of DNA methylation changes are subject to resetting in germlines, limiting the potential for transgenerational epigenetics stress memory. Asexual reproduction circumvents germlines, and may therefore be more conducive to long-term inheritance of epigenetic marks. Taking advantage of the rapid clonal reproduction of the common duckweed Lemna minor, we hypothesize that long-term, transgenerational stress memory from exposure to high temperature can be detected in DNA methylation profiles. Using a reduced representation bisulphite sequencing approach (epiGBS), we show that temperature stress induces DNA hypermethylation at many CG and CHG cytosine contexts but not CHH. Additionally, differential methylation in CHG context that was observed was still detected in a subset of cytosines, even after 3–12 generations of culturing in a common environment. This demonstrates a memory effect of stress reflected in the methylome and that persists over multiple clonal generations. Structural annotation revealed that this memory effect in CHG methylation was enriched in transposable elements. The observed epigenetic stress memory is probably caused by stable transgenerational persistence of temperature-induced DNA methylation variants across clonal generations. To the extent that such epigenetic memory has functional consequences for gene expression and phenotypes, this result suggests potential for long-term modulation of stress responses in asexual plants.},

Their highly reduced morphology and infrequent flowering result in a dearth of characters for distinguishing between the nearly 38 species that exhibit these tiny, closely-related and often morphologically similar features within the same family of plants.
Results: We developed a simple and rapid DNA-based molecular identification system for the Lemnaceae based on sequence polymorphisms. We compared the barcoding potential of the seven plastid-markers proposed by the CBOL (Consortium for the Barcode of Life) plant-working group to discriminate species within the land plants in 97 accessions representing 31 species from the family of Lemnaceae. A Lemnaceae-specific set of PCR and sequencing primers were designed for four plastid coding genes (rpoB, rpoC1, rbcL and matK) and three noncoding spacers (atpF-atpH, psbK-psbI and trnH-psbA) based on the Lemna minor chloroplast genome sequence. We assessed the ease of amplification and sequencing for these markers, examined the extent of the barcoding gap between intraand inter-specific variation by pairwise distances, evaluated successful identifications based on direct sequence comparison of the “best close match” and the construction of a phylogenetic tree.
Conclusions: Based on its reliable amplification, straightforward sequence alignment, and rates of DNA variation between species and within species, we propose that the atpF-atpH noncoding spacer could serve as a universal DNA barcoding marker for species-level identification of duckweeds.},

Alternative explanations include, for example, changes in the transcription rates of one or more pathway components. To measure the effect of heat shock on the simultaneous rates of transcription of selected genes encoding five Ub pathway components (Ub, E1, E2, β subunit and ATPase subunit of the 26S proteasome), a semi-quantitative RT-PCR method was developed using cDNA normalized against the housekeeping gene encoding the 18S ribosomal RNA. Whilst Ub transcription is abruptly increased, there is a moderate increment in the transcription of E1 and the β subunit, a moderate reduction in the transcription of the ATPase subunit and a marked reduction in the case of E2, indicating a differential transcription pattern of the various components of the Ub/proteasome pathway in L. minor subjected to high temperatures. These observations suggest that the increment in the Ub/proteasome pathway intermediates is due to an augmented supply of substrates derived from the stress-induced damage imposed on the cellular proteins. The initial build up of intermediates occurs not only at the expense of the preexisting pool of free Ub, but also as a result of the prompt increase in Ub expression.},

The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of Hsp70 as a biomarker of stress produced by increased temperature, osmotic pressure, and exposure to cadmium and sodium chloride in marine macroalgae and fresh water plant species. An indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IC-ELISA) was developed with a working range of 0.025 Á/10 mg ml(1 using a monoclonal antibody raised against purified Hsp70 of Phaseolus aureus (mung bean). Fucus serratus (toothed wrack), Chondrus crispus (Stackhouse or Carrageen moss), Ulva lactuca (sea lettuce) and Lemna minor (common duckweed) sample extracts were stressed for up to 24 h and then tested in the IC-ELISA. The presence of Hsp70 and cross-reactivity of the monoclonal antibody was confirmed by Western blot. The heat shock response was confirmed in each species using a 2-h 428C treatment. Following heat shock, Hsp70 concentrations increased to a peak at 2 h (F. serratus ) or 4 h (L. minor ), after which concentrations decreased. Osmotic and cadmium stresses also resulted in elevated Hsp70 concentrations in samples of F. serratus and L. minor when compared with unstressed controls. In both, osmotic and metal stress, the production of Hsp70 increased to a maximum and subsequently decreased as the stressor levels increased. Results suggest that Hsp70 IC-ELISA could potentially be applied to the detection of stress in these aquatic species, although it would probably be most effective when used in conjunction with other measurements to provide a stressor-specific biomarker profile or fingerprint.},

Hsp70 of Lemna minor increases after heat shock of 42ºC and peaks after 4 h. After this, it decreases.


Hsp70 protein concentration in L. minor is also increased with osmotic and cadmium stresses.


Discusses the potential use of duckweeds as biomarkers of water quality, and presents this method as a rapid way to assess stress in duckweeds I guess?

A heat shock response was conﬁrmed in Lemna exposed to high temperature: 35, 37.5, 40, or 42.5°C in short-term (4 h) treatments. The chemicals tested stimulated the biosynthesis of the cytoplasmic HSP70 protein in a concentration-dependent way (0.5–5 lM), higher in fronds exposed to lower doses of stressors. Additionally, production of HSP70 was greater after 4 h of incubation than after 7 days. The results suggest that HSP70 could be applied as a non-speciﬁc and sensitive detector of stress induced by different chemicals at concentrations below those that produce the type of response observed in classical cytotoxicity tests, such as growth inhibition.},

Lemna minor.


Motivated by the interest in developing methods to assess water quality and toxicity using duckweed.


Hsp70 as a biomarker in duckweeds, it refers back to Ireland 2004.


Hsp70 increases at 40 and 42ºC compared to 24ºC. 


Oddly, Hsp70 decreases at 35ºC compared to 24ºC. 


Hsp70 is not statistically different between 24 and 37.5ºC.

While much is known about mechanisms that regulate initiation of flowering, end-of-flowering remains largely uncharacterized. End-of-flowering in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) consists of quasi-synchronous arrest of inflorescences, but it is unclear how arrest is correctly timed with respect to environmental stimuli and reproductive success. Here, we showed that Arabidopsis inflorescence arrest is a complex developmental phenomenon, which includes the arrest of the inflorescence meristem (IM), coupled with a separable “floral arrest” of all unopened floral primordia; these events occur well before visible inflorescence arrest. We showed that global inflorescence removal delays both IM and floral arrest, but that local fruit removal only delays floral arrest, emphasizing their separability. We tested whether cytokinin regulates inflorescence arrest, and found that cytokinin signaling dynamics mirror IM activity, while cytokinin treatment can delay both IM and floral arrest. We further showed that gain-of-function cytokinin receptor mutants can delay IM and floral arrest; conversely, loss-of-function mutants prevented the extension of flowering in response to inflorescence removal. Collectively, our data suggest that the dilution of cytokinin among an increasing number of sink organs leads to end-of-flowering in Arabidopsis by triggering IM and floral arrest.},

We demonstrate that maternal past and current temperature experience are transduced to the FT locus in silique phloem. In turn, FT controls seed dormancy through inhibition of proanthocyanidin synthesis in fruits, resulting in altered seed coat tannin content. Our data reveal that maternal temperature history is integrated through FT in the fruit to generate a metabolic signal that entrains the behavior of progeny seeds according to time of year.},

            The switch from vegetative to reproductive growth is extremely stable even if plants are only transiently exposed to environmental stimuli that trigger flowering. In the photoperiodic pathway, a mobile signal, florigen, encoded by FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in Arabidopsis thaliana, induces flowering. Because FT activity in leaves is not maintained after transient photoperiodic induction, the molecular basis for stable floral commitment is unclear. Here, we show that Polycomb-group (Pc-G) proteins, which mediate epigenetic gene regulation, maintain the identity of inflorescence and floral meristems after floral induction. Thus, plants with reduced Pc-G activity show a remarkable increase of cauline leaves under noninductive conditions and floral reversion when shifted from inductive to noninductive conditions. These phenotypes are almost completely suppressed by loss of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) and SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE, which both delay flowering and promote vegetative shoot identity. Upregulation of FLC in Pc-G mutants leads to a strong decrease of FT expression in inflorescences. We find that this activity of FT is needed to prevent floral reversion. Collectively, our results reveal that floral meristem identity is at least partially maintained by a daylength-independent role of FT whose expression is indirectly sustained by Pc-G activity.},

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we have shown that FLC binds to a region of the first intron of FT that contains a putative CArG box, and have confirmed that FLC binds to a CArG box in the promoter of the SOC1 gene.

It is therefore not surprising that plants constantly monitor endogenous and environmental signals, such as day length (photoperiod) and temperature, to adjust the timing of the floral transition. Temperature in particular has been shown to have a tremendous effect on the timing of flowering: the effect of prolonged periods of cold, called the vernalization response, has been extensively studied and the underlying epigenetic mechanisms are reasonably well understood in Arabidopsis thaliana. In contrast, the effect of moderate changes in ambient growth temperature on the progression of flowering, the thermosensory pathway, is only starting to be understood on the molecular level. Several genes and molecular mechanisms underlying the thermosensory pathway have already been identified and characterized in detail. At a time when global temperature is rising due to climate change, this knowledge will be pivotal to ensure crop production in the future.},

The main splicing variant, FLM-β, is a well-documented floral repressor that is down-regulated in response to increasing ambient growth temperature. Two hypotheses have been formulated to explain how flowering time is modulated by AS of FLM. In the first model a second splice variant, FLM-δ, acts as a dominant negative isoform that competes with FLM-β at elevated ambient temperatures, thereby indirectly promoting flowering. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the induction of flowering at elevated temperatures is caused only by reduced FLM-β expression. To better understand the role of the two FLM splice forms, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 technology to specifically delete the exons that characterize each splice variant. Lines that produced repressive FLM-β but were incapable of producing FLM-δ were late flowering. In contrast, FLM-β knockout lines that still produced FLM-δ flowered early, but not earlier than the flm-3 loss of function mutant, as would be expected if FLM-δ had a dominant-negative effect on flowering. Our data support the role of FLM-β as a flower repressor and provide evidence that a contribution of FLM-δ to the regulation of flowering time in wild-type A. thaliana seems unlikely.},

Results showed that L. minor C2 had the highest N and P content, while L. punctata C3 had the highest starch content, and the mixture of L. punctata C3 and L. minor C2 had the greatest nutrient removal rate and the highest biomass. Compared with L. punctata C3 and L. minor C2 in monoculture, their biomass in mixture increased by 17.0\% and 39.8\%, respectively.},

	abstract = {In monocarpic plants, all reproductive meristem activity arrests and ﬂower production ceases after the production of a certain number of fruits. This proliferative arrest (PA) is an evolutionary adaptation that ensures nutrient availability for seed production. Moreover, PA is a process of agronomic interest because it affects the duration of the ﬂowering period and therefore fruit production. While our knowledge of the inputs and genetic factors controlling the initiation of the ﬂowering period is extensive, little is known about the regulatory pathways and cellular events that participate in the end of ﬂowering and trigger PA. Here, we characterize with high spatiotemporal resolution the cellular and molecular changes related to cell proliferation and meristem activity in the shoot apical meristem throughout the ﬂowering period and PA. Our results suggest that cytokinin (CK) signaling repression precedes PA and that this hormone is sufﬁcient to prevent and revert the process. We have also observed that repression of known CK downstream factors, such as type B cyclins and WUSCHEL (WUS), correlates with PA. These molecular changes are accompanied by changes in cell size and number likely caused by the cessation of cell division and WUS activity during PA. Parallel assays in fruitfull (ful) mutants, which do not undergo PA, have revealed that FUL may promote PA via repression of these CK-dependent pathways. Moreover, our data allow to deﬁne two phases, based on the relative contribution of FUL, that lead to PA: an early reduction of CK-related events and a late blocking of these events.},

VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE3 (VIN3) forms a complex with Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which mediates the trimethylation of H3K27 to repress target gene expression. In rice, four genes (OsVIL1-OsVIL4) encoding the VIN3-like proteins are expressed ubiquitously in various tissues. Null mutants of osvil2 display pleiotropic phenotypes such as altered flowering time, floral organ defects, and reduced tiller size. In contrast, osvil1 mutants did not show significant phenotypes except in fertilization compared with the wild type. However, transgenic plants overexpressing OsVIL1 showed phenotypes of increased biomass and grain yield. Cross-sections of the basal region of elongating stems revealed that the increased biomass was mediated by inducing cell proliferation in the meristem. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that OsVIL1 repressed expression of cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase gene (OsCKX2) by binding to the promoter and genic regions of OsCKX2. We also observed that OsVIL1 modified the levels of H3K27me3 in the OsCKX2 chromatin. Because OsCKX2 encodes an enzyme that degrades active cytokinin, we conclude that OsVIL1 functions in the regulation of endogenous active cytokinin levels, thereby increasing plant height and productivity.},

	abstract = {Understanding the mechanism by which plants respond to cold stress and strengthen their tolerance to low temperatures is an important and challenging task in plant sciences. Experiments have established that the first step in the perception and transduction of the cold stress signal consists of a transient influx of Ca2+. This Ca2+ influx triggers the activation of a cascade of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reactions that eventually affects the expression of C-repeat-binding factors (CBFs, notably CBF3), which were shown in many plants to control resistance to cold stress by regulating the expression of cold-regulated (COR) genes. Based on experimental observations mostly made on Arabidopsis thaliana, we build a computational model for the cold response pathway in plants, from the transduction of the cold signal via the transient influx of Ca2+ to the activation of the phosphorylation cascade leading to CBF3 expression. We explore the dynamics of this regulatory network by means of numerical simulations and compare the results with experimental observations on the dynamics of the cold response, both for the wild type and for mutants. The simulations show how, in response to cold stress, a brief Ca2+ influx, which is over in minutes, is transduced along the successive steps of the network to trigger the expression of cold response genes such as CBF3 within hours. Sometimes, instead of a single Ca2+ spike the decrease in temperature brings about a train of high-frequency Ca2+ oscillations. The model is applied to both types of Ca2+ signaling. We determine the dynamics of the network in response to a series of identical cold stresses, to account for the observation of desensitization and resensitization. The analysis of the model predicts the possibility of an oscillatory expression of CBF3 originating from the negative feedback exerted by ZAT12, a factor itself controlled by CBF3. Finally, we extend the model to incorporate the circadian control of CBF3 expression, to account for the gating of the response to cold stress by the plant circadian clock.},

Comparing to wild type, B1L knockout mutants were more sensitive to freezing treatment, whereas B1L-overexpressing lines were more tolerant. The expression of CBFs and CBF target genes was significantly decreased in b1l mutant. Using yeast two-hybrid screening system, 14-3-3λ was identified as one of proteins interacting with B1L. The interaction was confirmed with bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay. Biochemical assays revealed that b1l mutation promoted the degradation of CBF3 compared to wild type, whereas 14-3-3κλ mutant and b1l 14-3-3κλ mutant suppressed the degradation of CBF3. Consistently, 14-3-3κλ and b1l 14-3-3κλ mutants showed enhanced freezing tolerance compared to wild type. These results indicate that B1L enhances the freezing tolerance of plants, at least partly through stabilizing CBF.

B1L transcription is upregulated by cold within hours.


B1L regulates CBF transcription - in the b1l mutant there is less CBF1-3 transcript level after 3 hours of cold (compared to wt).


I am not convinced that it is explained how this happens.




Transcriptional regulation of CBF by B1L is dependent on 14-3-3, in the double mutant the CBF transcript level is similar to wt.


B1L regulates CBF post-transcriptionally, it binds to 14-3-3 decreasing the degradation of CBF1-3 protein by 14-3-3s.


This is all proved.




The final model does not really include the transcriptional regulation, why?

In the temperate zones, both photoperiod and temperature fluctuate in a somewhat predictable manner through the seasons, although a transient shift to low temperature is also encountered during changing seasons, such as early spring. Although low temperatures are known to delay flowering by inducing the floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), it is not fully understood how temperature signals are coordinated with photoperiodic signals in the timing of seasonal flowering. Here, we show that the cold signaling activator INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION 1 (ICE1), FLC and the floral promoter SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) constitute an elaborate signaling network that integrates cold signals into flowering pathways. The cold-activated ICE1 directly induces the gene encoding FLC, which represses SOC1 expression, resulting in delayed flowering. In contrast, under floral promotive conditions, SOC1 inhibits the binding of ICE1 to the promoters of the FLC gene, inducing flowering with a reduction of freezing tolerance. These observations indicate that the ICE1-FLC-SOC1 signaling network contributes to the fine-tuning of flowering during changing seasons.},

In addition to inducing adaptive defenses, such as the production of osmotic factors to prevent freezing and the reprogramming of transcriptional pathways, cold temperatures induce changes in plant growth and development which can affect the plant life cycle. In this review, we summarize recent progress in characterizing cold-related genes and the pathways that allow transduction of the cold signal in plants, focusing primarily on studies in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa). We summarize cold perception and signal transduction from the plasma membrane to the nucleus, which involves cold sensors, calcium signals, calcium-binding proteins, mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, and the C-repeat binding factor/dehydration-responsive element binding pathways, as well as trehalose metabolism. Finally, we describe the balance between plant organogenesis and cold tolerance mechanisms in rice. This review encapsulates the known cold signaling factors in plants and provides perspectives for ongoing cold signaling research.},

‘Vernalization prevents floral transition and enables vegetative growth before winter cold exposure.


Winter annual and biennial temperate grasses are vernalized at an early stage of vegetative growth \& development.


When temperature rises in spring, the ‘vernalized states’ are maintained or remembered through cell divisions during subsequent growth \& development to enable transition to flowering. = ‘Memory of winter cold’


Vernalization in Arabidopsis


Only necessary in winter annuals that over-winter.


Winter annuals bear dominant alleles of FRI (scaffold protein) and FLC (transcription factor).


FLC is a floral repressor, and FRI is a positive regulator of FLC expression.


Many genes are requried for FRI-dependent activation of FLC including: 


SWR1C (complex that deposits the histone variant H2A.Z).


PAF1C (RNA pol II associated factor 1 complex, subunits include ELF7 and five others).


FRI partners (form a stable complex with FRI called FRIc).




FRI or FRIc components interact with other components (e.g., SWR1C and PAF1c) to form a supercomplex at the FLC locus. This is called FRI supercomplex (FRIsc).


FRIsc participates in a variety of processes, importantly active histone modifications on FLC chromatin, that promote FLC expression and mRNA maturation.



Prior to vernalization, (1) FLC chromatin is at an actively transcribed state. During vernalization, (2) FLC transcription is turned off by reducing the levels of active chromatin marks. Subsequently, (3) polycomb group proteins are enriched at the locus to:


Deposit repressive histone H3K27me3. This is done by the methyltransferase complex PRC2.


Mediate other repressive chromatin modifications.




During (3), chromatin is compactted resulting in a silenced state at FLC.



The PRC2 methyltransferase complex is composed of:


An H3K27 methyltransferase, formed by:


CLF


SWN




Three structural subunits:


VRN2


FIE


MSI1







VIN3 expression is induced by prolonged cold exposure (only expressed in cold). 


VIN3 (together with VIL1/VRN5) joins the PRC2 to participate in H3K27 trimethylation at the FLC locus.


(…)


Vernalization in temperate grasses


Winter cereals: planted in autumn, bloom in the 2nd year of spring, after experiencing a long period of cold.


Although temperate grasses hold FLC relatives, vernalization is regulated primarily by an FLC-independent network in Pooidae.



In wheat, vernalization response is controlled by a core regulatory loop composed of 3 genes:


VRN1, orthologous to FUL/AP1.


VRN2, zinc finger protein, potent floral repressor.


VRN3/FT1, homolog of FT, mobile florigen.




Prior to winter, expression is low for VRN1 and high for VRN2, which repressed VRN3/FT1 expression preventing flowering.


With prolonged cold exposure, VRN1 expression is quantitatively induced and VRN2 expression is gradually downregulated.


After return to warmth, VRN1 expression is maintained at high levels, repressing VRN2 expression. This allows VRN3/FT1 induction by long-day signals through the photoperiod pathway.


VRN1 induces VRN3 expression in the leaves, VRN3 protein then is transported to the SAM to promote VRN1 expression.



GRP2 binds to the 1st intron of VRN1 pre-mRNA. This leads to reduction of VRN1 mature mRNA levels, prior to the cold.


 VER2 expression is induced by prolonged cold. It directly interacts with GRP2 relocating it from nucleus to cytoplasm and relieving its binding to VRN1.



Prior to cold, H3K27me3 repressive marks are enriched at VRN1. 


Cold induction of VRN1 is associated with a decrease of H3K27me3 and increase of H3K4me3. 


H3K27me3 is a repressive mark deposited by PRC2.


H3K4me3 is a mark for actively transcribed chromatin catalyzed by H3K4 methyltransferase complexes (such as COMPASS-like).





After temperature rises in spring, VRN1 expression remains high, which represents the ‘memory of winter cold’ obtained through epigenetic mechanisms. Achieved probably by:


Gradual increase in active H3K4me3


Gradual decrease in repressive H3K27me3




After the return to warmth, chromatin of VRN1 remains in the active state.



There is little change in chromatin state for VRN2. Unlike in Arabidopsis, the chromatin state of the floral repressor VRN2 is unlikely to be part of the cold memory.



It is possible that epigenetic regulation also takes place for VRN3/FT1. At least this is the case in B. distachyon, where FT2 chromatin remains in an actvie state after return to warmth.

            The whole-genome response of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) exposed to different types and durations of abiotic stress has now been described by a wealth of publicly available microarray data. When combined with studies of how gene expression is affected in mutant and transgenic Arabidopsis with altered ability to transduce the low temperature signal, these data can be used to test the interactions between various low temperature-associated transcription factors and their regulons. We quantized a collection of Affymetrix microarray data so that each gene in a particular regulon could vote on whether a cis-element found in its promoter conferred induction (+1), repression (−1), or no transcriptional change (0) during cold stress. By statistically comparing these election results with the voting behavior of all genes on the same gene chip, we verified the bioactivity of novel cis-elements and defined whether they were inductive or repressive. Using in silico mutagenesis we identified functional binding consensus variants for the transcription factors studied. Our results suggest that the previously identified ICEr1 (induction of CBF expression region 1) consensus does not correlate with cold gene induction, while the ICEr3/ICEr4 consensuses identified using our algorithms are present in regulons of genes that were induced coordinate with observed ICE1 transcript accumulation and temporally preceding genes containing the dehydration response element. Statistical analysis of overlap and cis-element enrichment in the ICE1, CBF2, ZAT12, HOS9, and PHYA regulons enabled us to construct a regulatory network supported by multiple lines of evidence that can be used for future hypothesis testing.},

	abstract = {The CBF cold response pathway has a prominent role in cold acclimation. The pathway includes action of three transcription factors, CBF1, 2 and 3 (also known as DREB1b, c and a, respectively), that are rapidly induced in response to low temperature followed by expression of the CBF-targeted genes (the CBF regulon) that act in concert to increase plant-freezing tolerance. The results of transcriptome proﬁling and mutagenesis experiments, however, indicate that additional cold response pathways exist and may have important roles in life at low temperature. To further understand the roles that the CBF proteins play in conﬁguring the low temperature transcriptome and to identify additional transcription factors with roles in cold acclimation, we used the Affymetrix GeneChipÒ containing probe sets for approximately 24 000 Arabidopsis genes to deﬁne a core set of cold-responsive genes and to determine which genes were targets of CBF2 and 6 other transcription factors that appeared to be coordinately regulated with CBF2. A total of 514 genes were placed in the core set of cold-responsive genes, 302 of which were upregulated and 212 downregulated. Hierarchical clustering and bioinformatic analysis indicated that the 514 cold-responsive transcripts could be assigned to one of seven distinct expression classes and identiﬁed multiple potential novel cis-acting cold-regulatory elements. Eightyﬁve cold-induced genes and eight cold-repressed genes were assigned to the CBF2 regulon. An additional nine cold-induced genes and 15 cold-repressed genes were assigned to a regulon controlled by ZAT12. Of the 25 core cold-induced genes that were most highly upregulated (induced over 15-fold), 19 genes (84\%) were induced by CBF2 and another two genes (8\%) were regulated by both CBF2 and ZAT12. Thus, the large majority (92\%) of the most highly induced genes belong to the CBF and ZAT12 regulons. Constitutive expression of ZAT12 in Arabidopsis caused a small, but reproducible, increase in freezing tolerance, indicating a role for the ZAT12 regulon in cold acclimation. In addition, ZAT12 downregulated the expression of the CBF genes indicating a role for ZAT12 in a negative regulatory circuit that dampens expression of the CBF cold response pathway.},

	abstract = {CBF (DREB1) genes act as nodes of regulatory network in Arabidopsis response to cold stress, which are conserved in many plants. Combined use of genetic and molecular approaches, a series of regulatory genes involved in CBF cold response pathway have been isolated and analyzed. Among them, some gene products are thought to function directly in transcription. HOS1 is a negative regulator of CBFs, whereas FRY2 acts as a transcriptional repressor and LOS2 as a positive regulator in the pathway. ICE1, the regulator of the CBF3 may be regulated by HOS1. Arabidopsis transcriptome proﬁling studies suggest multiplicity and complexity of the cold-responsive pathways. It is underestimated that 1000 genes are cold-responsive in the entire Arabidosis genome, some of which are transient or up-regulated and others of which are long lived or down-regulated. In addition, the data indicate that multiple regulatory pathways are activated during cold acclimation in addition to the CBF cold-responsive pathway. Two transcription factors, RAV1 and ZAT12 probably operate in pathways that are parallel to those of the CBFs. By contrast, two AP2 domain proteins, RAP2.6 and RAP2.1 might be targets of the CBF activators. Moreover, the latest results show that the expression of CBFs in Arabidopsis is also regulated by ABA, light and the circadian clock. It is suggested that there exist extensive crosstalks between the CBF cold response pathway and the non-temperature signaling transduction pathways.},

	abstract = {Background: Plants respond to abiotic stress through complex regulation of transcription, including both transcriptional activation and repression. Dehydration-responsive-element binding protein (DREB)-type transcription factors are well known to play important roles in adaptation to abiotic stress. The mechanisms by which DREB-type transcription factors activate stress-induced gene expression have been relatively well studied. However, little is known about how DREB-type transcriptional repressors modulate plant stress responses. In this study, we report the functional analysis of RAP2.1, a DREB-type transcriptional repressor.
Results: RAP2.1 possesses an APETALA2 (AP2) domain that binds to dehydration-responsive elements (DREs) and an ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif, as the repression domain located at the C-terminus of the protein. Expression of RAP2.1 is strongly induced by drought and cold stress via an ABA-independent pathway. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing RAP2.1 show enhanced sensitivity to cold and drought stresses, while rap2.1-1 and rap2.1-2 T-DNA insertion alleles result in reduced sensitivity to these stresses. The reduced stress sensitivity of the plant containing the rap2.1 allele can be genetically complemented by the expression of RAP2.1, but not by the expression of EAR-motif-mutated RAP2.1. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis has identified Responsive to desiccation/Cold-regulated (RD/COR) genes as downstream targets of RAP2.1 in vivo. Stressinduced expression of the RD/COR genes is repressed by overexpression of RAP2.1 and is increased in plants expressing the rap2.1 allele. In addition, RAP2.1 can negatively regulate its own expression by binding to DREs present in its own promoter. Our data suggest that RAP2.1 acts as a negative transcriptional regulator in defence responses to cold and drought stress in Arabidopsis.
Conclusions: A hypothetical model for the role of RAP2.1 in modulating plant responses to cold and drought is proposed in this study. It appears that RAP2.1 acts as a negative “subregulon” of DREB-type activators and is involved in the precise regulation of expression of stress-related genes, acting to keep stress responses under tight control.},

The transcription factors in the CBF family, existing in multiple plant species, are the key regulators of the coldresponsive (COR) genes. CBF1 and CBF3 are regulated in a different way from CBF2, and CBF4 is the only known CBF gene definitely involved in abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent signaling pathways. RAP2.1 and RAP2.6 are the downstream regulators under CBFs. The upstream regulators of the CBF named inducer of CBF expression (ICE) acts as a positive regulator of CBFs. Meanwhile, these CBF signaling pathway components could associate with many other transcription activators and repressors in regulating gene expression when plants are under LT stress. HOS1 negatively regulates ICE1, which down regulates MYB15, an upstream repressor of CBFs. ZAT12 participates in the repression of CBFs, while ZAT10 and FRY2 negatively regulate the CBF-target genes. ADF5 was recently also found to repress CBFs. LOS2 works against ZAT10, and LOS4 positively regulates CBFs. SFR6 is involved in the modification of CBFs to activate the COR genes, and SIZ1-dependent sumoylation plays a positive role in the regulation of ICE1. The utilization of CBF-dependent signaling components has a broad perspective in the field of plant breeding for enhancing crop LT tolerance.},

            Many plants, including Arabidopsis, increase in freezing tolerance in response to low, nonfreezing temperatures, a phenomenon known as cold acclimation. Previous studies established that cold acclimation involves rapid expression of the CBF transcriptional activators (also known as DREB1 proteins) in response to low temperature followed by induction of the CBF regulon (CBF-targeted genes), which contributes to an increase in freezing tolerance. Here, we present the results of transcriptome-profiling experiments indicating the existence of multiple low-temperature regulatory pathways in addition to the CBF cold response pathway. The transcript levels of ∼8000 genes were determined at multiple times after plants were transferred from warm to cold temperature and in warm-grown plants that constitutively expressed CBF1, CBF2, or CBF3. A total of 306 genes were identified as being cold responsive, with transcripts for 218 genes increasing and those for 88 genes decreasing threefold or more at one or more time points during the 7-day experiment. These results indicate that extensive downregulation of gene expression occurs during cold acclimation. Of the cold-responsive genes, 48 encode known or putative transcription factors. Two of these, RAP2.1 and RAP2.6, were activated by CBF expression and thus presumably control subregulons of the CBF regulon. Transcriptome comparisons indicated that only 12\% of the cold-responsive genes are certain members of the CBF regulon. Moreover, at least 28\% of the cold-responsive genes were not regulated by the CBF transcription factors, including 15 encoding known or putative transcription factors, indicating that these cold-responsive genes are members of different low-temperature regulons. Significantly, CBF expression at warm temperatures repressed the expression of eight genes that also were downregulated by low temperature, indicating that in addition to gene induction, gene repression is likely to play an integral role in cold acclimation.},

Here, we show that one subgroup III member of the B-box (BBX) family, BBX17, is a repressor of floral transition under long-day conditions. BBX17 contains a B-box domain and a CCT domain. Although the phenotype of the BBX17 loss-of-function plants was comparable to that of wild-type plants, BBX17-overexpression plants displayed a delayed-flowering phenotype under long-day conditions. The delayed-flowering phenotype was not the result of an altered CONSTANS (CO) expression level but rather the repression of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) expression level. BBX17 physically associated with CO and repressed its ability to control FT expression. Furthermore, the BBX17 protein degraded in the dark, but irradiating seedlings with white, blue, red or far-red light stabilized the BBX17 level. We also proved that the degradation of BBX17 was via 26S proteasome and requires COP1. Thus, BBX17 acts as a key factor in the CO–FT regulatory system to control Arabidopsis thaliana flowering.},

	abstract = {As a result of global warming, vegetation suffers from repeated freeze-thaw cycles caused by more frequent short-term low temperatures induced by hail, snow, or night frost. Therefore, short-term freezing stress of plants should be investigated particularly in light of the current climatic conditions. Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) plays a central role in the metabolism of alcohols and aldehydes and it is a key enzyme in anaerobic fermentation. ADH1 responds to plant growth and environmental stress; however, the function of ADH1 in the response to short-term freezing stress remains unknown. Using real-time quantitative fluorescence PCR, the expression level of ADH1 was analyzed at low temperature (4°C). The lethal temperature was calculated based on the electrolyte leakage tests for both ADH1 deletion mutants (adh1) and wild type (WT) plants. To further investigate the relationship between ADH1 and cold tolerance in plants, low-Mr polar metabolite analyses of Arabidopsis adh1 and WT were performed at cold temperatures using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. This investigation focused on freezing treatments (cold acclimation group: −6°C for 2 h with prior 4°C for 7 d, cold shock group: −6°C for 2 h without cold acclimation) and recovery (23°C for 24 h) with respect to seedling growth at optimum temperature. The experimental results revealed a significant increase in ADH1 expression during low temperature treatment (4°C) and at a higher lethal temperature in adh1 compared to that in the WT. Retention time indices and specific mass fragments were used to monitor 263 variables and annotate 78 identified metabolites. From these analyses, differences in the degree of metabolite accumulation between adh1 and WT were detected, including soluble sugars (e.g., sucrose) and amino acids (e.g., asparagine). In addition, the correlation-based network analysis highlighted some metabolites, e.g., melibiose, fumaric acid, succinic acid, glycolic acid, and xylose, which enhanced connectedness in adh1 network under cold chock. When considered collectively, the results showed that adh1 possessed a metabolic response to freezing stress and ADH1 played an important role in the cold stress response of a plant. These results expands our understanding of the short-term freeze response of ADH1 in plants.},

It has been shown that DGAT1 plays an important role in seed development because Arabidopsis with mutations at the TAG1 locus accumulate less seed oil. There is also evidence showing that DGAT1 is active after seed germination. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of mutations of DGAT1 on postembryonic development in Arabidopsis. We carried out detailed analyses of two tag1 mutants in different ecotypic backgrounds of Arabidopsis. Results show that during germination and seedling growth, seed storage TAG degradation was not affected in thetag1 mutants. However, sugar content of the mutant seedlings is altered, and activities of the hexokinases are significantly increased in the tag1 mutant seedlings. The tag1 mutants are also more sensitive to abscisic acid, glucose, and osmotic strength of the medium in germination and seedling growth.},

While many components of freezing tolerance have been identified in model species under controlled laboratory conditions, little is known about the mechanisms that impart freezing tolerance in natural populations of wild species. Here, we performed a quantitative trait locus (QTL) study of acclimated freezing tolerance in seedlings of Boechera stricta, a highly adapted relative of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) native to the Rocky Mountains. A single QTL was identified that contained the gene encoding ACYL-COENZYME A:DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE1 (BstDGAT1), whose expression is highly cold responsive. The primary metabolic enzyme DGAT1 catalyzes the final step in assembly of triacylglycerol (TAG) by acyl transfer from acyl-CoA to diacylglycerol. Freezing tolerant plants showed higher DGAT1 expression during cold acclimation than more sensitive plants, and this resulted in increased accumulation of TAG in response to subsequent freezing. Levels of oligogalactolipids that are produced by SFR2 (SENSITIVE TO FREEZING2), an indispensable element of freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis, were also higher in freezing-tolerant plants. Furthermore, overexpression of AtDGAT1 led to increased freezing tolerance. We propose that DGAT1 confers freezing tolerance in plants by supporting SFR2-mediated remodeling of chloroplast membranes.},

Here, we show that DGAT1, DGK2, DGK3, and DGK5 contribute to the response to cold in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). With or without cold acclimation, the dgat1 mutants exhibited higher sensitivity upon freezing exposure compared with the wild type. Under cold conditions, the dgat1 mutants showed reduced expression of C-REPEAT/DRE BINDING FACTOR2 and its regulons, which are essential for the acquisition of cold tolerance. Lipid profiling revealed that freezing significantly increased the levels of PA and DAG while decreasing TAG in the rosettes of dgat1 mutant plants. During freezing stress, the accumulation of PA in dgat1 plants stimulated NADPH oxidase activity and enhanced RbohD-dependent hydrogen peroxide production compared with the wild type. Moreover, the cold-inducible transcripts of DGK2, DGK3, and DGK5 were significantly more up-regulated in the dgat1 mutants than in the wild type during cold stress. Consistent with this observation, dgk2, dgk3, and dgk5 knockout mutants showed improved tolerance and attenuated PA production in response to freezing temperatures.

The results of domain swapping and deletion experiments showed that the domain sequences encompassing the N-terminal RRM of GRPs were found to be crucial to the ability to complement cold-sensitive Escherichia coli mutant cells under cold stress, RNA melting ability, and freezing tolerance ability in the grp7 loss-of-function Arabidopsis mutant. In particular, the N-terminal 24 amino acid extension of AtGRP4 impedes the RNA chaperone activity. Collectively, these results reveal that domain sequences and overall folding of GRPs governed by a specific modular arrangement of RRM and glycine-rich sequences are critical to the RNA chaperone activity of GRPs during the cold adaptation process in cells.},

CSDP1 and GRP7 had DNA melting activity, and enhanced RNase activity. In contrast, CSDP2 and GRP4 had no DNA melting activity and did not enhance RNAase activity.

            The Arabidopsis TCH4 gene is up-regulated in expression by diverse environmental and hormonal stimuli. BecauseTCH4 encodes a xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase, this change in expression may reflect a recruitment of cell wall-modifying activity in response to environmental stress and growth. How diverse stimuli lead to the common response of TCH4 expression regulation is not known. Here, we show that induction of expression by the diverse stimuli of touch, darkness, cold, heat, and brassinosteroids (BRs) is conferred to reporter genes by the same 102-bp 5′-untranscribed TCH4region; this result is consistent with the idea that shared regulatory elements are employed by diverse stimuli. Distal regions influence magnitude and kinetics of expression and likely harbor regulatory elements that are redundant with those located more proximal to the transcriptional start site. Substitution of the proximal regulatory region sequences in the context of distal elements does not disrupt inducible expression. TCH4 expression induction is transcriptional, at least in part because 5′-untranscribed sequences are sufficient to confer this regulation. However, 5′-untranslated sequences are necessary and sufficient to confer the marked transience of TCH4 expression, most likely through an effect on mRNA stability. Perception of BR is not necessary forTCH4::GUS induction by environmental stimuli because regulation is intact in the BR-insensitive mutant,bri1-2. The full response to auxin, however, requires the functioning of BRI1. Developmental expression ofTCH4 is unlikely to be meditated by BR becauseTCH4::GUS is expressed in BR perception and biosynthetic mutants bri1-2 and det2-1, respectively.},

We statistically determined 939 cold-regulated genes with 655 upregulated and 284 downregulated. A large number of early cold-responsive genes encode transcription factors that likely control late-responsive genes, suggesting a multitude of transcriptional cascades. In addition, many genes involved in chromatin level and posttranscriptional regulation were also cold regulated, suggesting their involvement in cold-responsive gene regulation. A number of genes important for the biosynthesis or signaling of plant hormones, such as abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, and auxin, are regulated by cold stress, which is of potential importance in coordinating cold tolerance with growth and development. We compared the cold-responsive transcriptomes of the wild type and inducer of CBF expression 1 (ice1), a mutant defective in an upstream transcription factor required for chilling and freezing tolerance. The transcript levels of many cold-responsive genes were altered in the ice1 mutant not only during cold stress but also before cold treatments. Our study provides a global picture of the Arabidopsis cold-responsive transcriptome and its control by ICE1 and will be valuable for understanding gene regulation under cold stress and the molecular mechanisms of cold tolerance.},

We investigated a possible role of fluctuations in intracellular calcium ion concentra- tions ([Ca2+]) in the cold-shock-induced TCH gene expression. Transgenic plants harboring the apoaequorin gene were generated to monitor [Ca2+] and to test the necessity of cold-induced [Ca2+] increases for TCH expression. Cold-shock-induced [Ca2+] increases can be blocked by La3+ and Gd3+, putative plasma membrane Ca2+ channel blockers, and 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N[prime],N[prime]- tetraacetic acid, an extracellular Ca2+ chelator. Cold-shock-induced expression of the TCH genes is inhibited by levels of La3+, Gd3+, and 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N[prime],N[prime]-tetraacetic acid, that have been shown to block [Ca2+] increases. These data support the hypotheses that (a) intracellular [Ca2+] increases following cold shock require extracellular Ca2+ and may derive from a Ca2+ influx mediated by plasmalemma Ca2+ channels, and (b) cold up-regulation of expression of at least a subset of the TCH genes requires an intracellular [Ca2+] increase. The inhibitors are also shown to have stimulus-independent effects on gene expression, providing strong evidence that these commonly used chemicals have more complex effects than generally reported.},

An XET-related gene family exists in Arabidopsis thaliana, the members of which show differential regulation of expression. TCH4 expression is rapidly regulated by mechanical stimuli, temperature shifts, light, and hormones. As a first step in determining whether Arabidopsis XET-related proteins have distinct properties, we produced recombinant TCH4 protein in bacteria and determined its enzymatic characteristics. TCH4 specifically transglycosylates only xyloglucan. The enzyme prefers to transfer a portion of a donor polymer onto another xyloglucan polymer (acceptor); TCH4 will also utilize xyloglucan-derived oligosaccharides as acceptors but discriminates between differentially fucosylated oligosaccharides. TCH4 is most active at pH 6.0 to 6.5 and is surprisingly cold-tolerant with an optimum of 12 to 18[deg]C. TCH4 activity is enhanced by urea and bovine serum albumin, but not cations, reducing agents, or carboxymethylcellulose. These studies indicate that TCH4 is specific for xyloglucan, but that the molecular mass and the fucosyl content of the substrates influence enzymatic reaction rates. TCH4 is unlikely to play a role in acid-induced wall loosening but may function in cold acclimation or cold-tolerant growth.},

In addition, many plant species, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, respond to a subsequent exposure to mild, non-damaging freezing temperatures with an additional increase in freezing tolerance referred to as sub-zero acclimation (SZA). There is comparatively little information available about the molecular basis of SZA. However, previous transcriptomic studies indicated that cell wall modification may play an important role during SZA. Here we show that CA and SZA are accompanied by extensive changes in cell wall amount, composition and structure. While CA leads to a significant increase in cell wall amount, the relative proportions of pectin, hemicellulose and cellulose remained unaltered during both CA and SZA. However, both treatments resulted in more subtle changes in structure as determined by infrared spectroscopy and monosaccharide composition as determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These differences could be related through a proteomic approach to the accumulation of cell wall modifying enzymes such as pectin methylesterases, pectin methylesterase inhibitors and xyloglucan endotransglucosylases/hydrolases in the extracellular matrix.},

To explore the function of the core components in ABA signaling, we used the overexpression of RCARs transgenic plants to expose in heat or cold stress. In this study, overexpression of RCAR12 or RCAR13 (R12-OE or R13OE) transgenic plants had higher germination and survival rate than the wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis, indicating that they are both positively responsive to the high temperature. And the heat shock genes HSP18.2 and HSP70 were significantly induced by RCAR12 or RCAR13. Further, the results inferred that the over-expression of RCAR12 or RCAR13 could tolerance the cold stress, through induction CBFs expressions, the cold-responsive genes when plants were challenged the cold tress. And when complementation of RCAR12 to the 1124 mutant (R12:1124), the results indicated that RCAR12 could recover the insensitivity of 1124 to heat and cold stresses. Hence, we propose that RCAR12 and RCAR13, the ABA receptors, may play the positive roles in regulating the extreme temperature, including cold and high temperature in Arabidopsis.},

	abstract = {Background: The heat shock response of Arabidopsis thaliana is dependent upon a complex regulatory network involving twenty-one known transcription factors and four heat shock protein families. It is known that heat shock proteins (Hsps) and transcription factors (Hsfs) are involved in cellular response to various forms of stress besides heat. However, the role of Hsps and Hsfs under cold and non-thermal stress conditions is not well understood, and it is unclear which types of stress interact least and most strongly with Hsp and Hsf response pathways. To address this issue, we have analyzed transcriptional response profiles of Arabidopsis Hsfs and Hsps to a range of abiotic and biotic stress treatments (heat, cold, osmotic stress, salt, drought, genotoxic stress, ultraviolet light, oxidative stress, wounding, and pathogen infection) in both above and belowground plant tissues.
Results: All stress treatments interact with Hsf and Hsp response pathways to varying extents, suggesting considerable cross-talk between heat and non-heat stress regulatory networks. In general, Hsf and Hsp expression was strongly induced by heat, cold, salt, and osmotic stress, while other types of stress exhibited family or tissue-specific response patterns. With respect to the Hsp20 protein family, for instance, large expression responses occurred under all types of stress, with striking similarity among expression response profiles. Several genes belonging to the Hsp20, Hsp70 and Hsp100 families were specifically upregulated twelve hours after wounding in root tissue, and exhibited a parallel expression response pattern during recovery from heat stress. Among all Hsf and Hsp families, large expression responses occurred under ultraviolet-B light stress in aerial tissue (shoots) but not subterranean tissue (roots).
Conclusion: Our findings show that Hsf and Hsp family member genes represent an interaction point between multiple stress response pathways, and therefore warrant functional analysis under conditions apart from heat shock treatment. In addition, our analysis revealed several family and tissue-specific heat shock gene expression patterns that have not been previously described. These results have implications regarding the molecular basis of cross-tolerance in plant species, and raise new questions to be pursued in future experimental studies of the Arabidopsis heat shock response network.},

Both heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) protein are involved in cold stress responses in Arabidopsis. However, their roles in seed germination with regard to ABA signaling remain unknown. Here we demonstrated that Arabidopsis HSP70-16 and VDAC3 jointly suppress seed germination under cold stress conditions. At 4 C, both HSP70-16 and VDAC3 facilitated the efflux of ABA from the endosperm to the embryo and thus inhibited seed germination. HSP70-16 interacted with VDAC3 on the plasma membrane and in the nucleus, and the interplay between HSP70-16 and VDAC3 activated the opening of the VDAC3 ion channel. Our work established a novel function of HSP70-16 in seed germination under cold stress and a possible association of VDAC3 activity with ABA transportation from endosperm to embryo under cold stress conditions. This study reveals that HSP70-16 interacts with VDAC3 and facilitates the opening of the VDAC3 ion channel, which influences ABA efflux from endosperm to embryo, thus negatively regulates seed germination under cold stress.},

Abstract  Flowering plants integrate internal developmental signals with external environmental stimuli for precise flowering time control. The expression of BBX29 is up-regulated by low temperature treatment, but the biological function of BBX29 in low temperature response is unknown. In the current study, we examined the biological role of BBX29 and its close-related protein BBX28 in flowering time control under long-day conditions. Although neither BBX28 single mutant nor BBX29 single mutant has a flowering-associated phenotype, the bbx28 bbx29 double mutant plants have an obvious delayed flowering phenotype grown at low ambient temperature (16°C) compared to the wild-type (WT) plants. The expression of FT and TSF was lower in bbx28 bbx29 double mutant plants than in wild-type plants at 16°C. Both BBX28 and BBX29 interact with CONSTANS (CO), an important flowering integrator that directly binds to the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) promoter. In the effector-reporter assays, transcriptional activation activity of CO on the FT promoter was reduced in bbx28 bbx29 double mutant plants compared to that in WT plants. Taken together, our results reveal that BBX28 and BBX29 are promoters of flowering in Arabidopsis, especially at low ambient temperature.},

In the present work the effect of light under low temperature treatment was analyzed by using microarrays. Specific attention was paid to the up and down regulated genes by using promoter analysis. This approach revealed putative regulatory networks of transcription factors behind the induction or repression of the genes.
Results: Induction of a few oxidative stress related genes occurred only under the Cold/Light treatment including genes encoding iron superoxide dismutase (FeSOD) and glutathione-dependent hydrogen peroxide peroxidases (GPX). The ascorbate dependent water-water cycle genes showed no response to Cold/Light or Cold/Dark treatments. Cold/Light specifically induced genes encoding protective molecules like phenylpropanoids and photosynthesis-related carotenoids also involved in the biosynthesis of hormone abscisic acid (ABA) crucial for cold acclimation. The enhanced/ repressed transcript levels were not always reflected on the respective protein levels as demonstrated by dehydrin proteins.
Conclusion: Cold/Light up regulated twice as many genes as the Cold/Dark treatment and only the combination of light and low temperature enhanced the expression of several genes earlier described as cold-responsive genes. Cold/Light-induced genes included both cold-responsive transcription factors and several novel ones containing zinc-finger, MYB, NAC and AP2 domains. These are likely to function in concert in enhancing gene expression. Similar response elements were found in the promoter regions of both the transcription factors and their target genes implying a possible parallel regulation or amplification of the environmental signals according to the metabolic/redox state in the cells.},

Here, we demonstrate that the photomorphogenic repressors BBX28 and BBX29 positively regulate brassinosteroid (BR) signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Treatment with the BR brassinolide stabilized BBX28 and BBX29, which partially depended on BR INSENSITIVE1 (BRI1) and BIN2. bbx28 bbx29 seedlings exhibited larger cotyledon aperture than the wild-type when treated with brassinazole in the dark, which partially suppressed the closed cotyledons of brassinazole resistant 1-1D (bzr1-1D). Consistently, overexpressing BBX28 and BBX29 partially rescued the short hypocotyls of bri1-5 and bin2-1 in both the dark and light, while the loss-of-function of BBX28 and BBX29 partially suppressed the long hypocotyls of bzr1-1D in the light. BBX28 and BBX29 physically interacted with BR-ENHANCED EXPRESSION1 (BEE1), BEE2, and BEE3 and enhanced their binding to and activation of their target genes. Moreover, BBX28 and BBX29 as well as BEE1, BEE2, and BEE3 increased BZR1 accumulation to promote the BR signaling pathway. Therefore, both BBX28 and BBX29 interact with BEE1, BEE2, and BEE3 to orchestrate light and BR signaling by facilitating the transcriptional activity of BEE target genes. Our study provides insights into the pivotal roles of BBX28 and BBX29 as signal integrators in ensuring normal seedling development.},

Both an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and a yeast one-hybrid assay revealed that DREB2C145–528 was able to form a complex with the dehydration responsive element/C-repeat (DRE/CRT; A/GCCGAC) motif. A trans-activating ability test in yeast demonstrated that DREB2C could eﬀectively function as a trans-activator. Constitutive expression of DREB2C under the control of the cauliﬂower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter led to enhanced thermotolerance in transgenic lines of Arabidopsis.

RT-PCR showed that HsfA3 is the most up-regulated gene among the 21 Arabidopsis Hsfs in transgenic plants over-expressing DREB2C. DREB2C and HsfA3 displayed similar transcription patterns in response to HS and DREB2C speciﬁcally transactivated the DRE-dependent transcription of HsfA3 in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts. Yeast one-hybrid assays and in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays further showed that DREB2C interacts with two DREs located in the HsfA3 promoter with a binding preference for the distal DRE2. Deletion mutants of DREB2C indicated that transactivation activity was located in the C-terminal region. In addition, dual activator-reporter assays showed that the induction of heat shock protein (Hsp) genes in transgenic plants could be attributed to the transcriptional activity of HsfA3. Taken together, these results indicate that DREB2C and HsfA3 are key players in regulating the heat tolerance of Arabidopsis.},

This sub-family belongs to AP2 transcription factor family and plays a considerable role in improving abiotic stresses tolerance in plants. Therefore, it is of interest to identify critical cis-acting elements involved in abiotic stress responses. In this study, we survey promoter cis-elements for ATDREBs genes (Arabidopsis thaliana DREBs). Regulatory networks based on ATDREB candidate genes were also generated to find other genes that are functionally similar to DREBs. The study was conducted on all 20 Arabidopsis thaliana non redundant DREB genes stored in RefSeq database. Promoter analysis and regulatory network prediction was accomplished by use of Plant CARE program and GeneMANIA web tool, respectively. The results indicated that among all genes, DREB1A, DREB1C, DREB2C, DREB2G and DEAR3 have the most type of diverse motifs involved in abiotic stress responses. It is implied that co-operation of abscisic acid, ethylene, salicylic acid and methyl jasmonate signaling is crucial for the regulation of the expression of drought and cold responses through DREB transcription factors. Gene network analysis showed different co-expressed but functionally similar genes that had physical and functional interactions with candidate DREB genes.},

To identify the expression pattern of the DREB2C gene, which contains multiple transcription cis-regulatory elements in its promoter, an approximately 1.4 kb upstream DREB2C sequence was fused to the β-glucuronidase reporter gene (GUS) and the recombinant p1244 construct was transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. The promoter of the gene directed prominent GUS activity in the vasculature in diverse young dividing tissues. Upon applying heat stress (HS), GUS staining was also enhanced in the vasculature of the growing tissues. Analysis of a series of 5 -deletions of the DREB2C promoter revealed that a proximal upstream sequence sufﬁcient for the tissue-speciﬁc spatial and temporal induction of GUS expression by HS is localized in the promoter region between −204 and −34 bps relative to the transcriptional start site. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that nuclear protein binding activities speciﬁc to a −120 to −32 bp promoter fragment increased after HS. These results indicate that the TATA-proximal region and some latent trans-acting factors may cooperate in HS-induced activation of the Arabidopsis DREB2C promoter.},

	abstract = {In Arabidopsis, there are four homologs of class A1 heat shock factor (HSFA1) genes, which likely encode the master regulators of heat shock response (HSR). However, previous studies with double knockout (KO) mutants were unable to confirm this point probably due to functional redundancy. Here, we generated a quadruple KO (QK) and four triple KO mutants to dissect their functions. Our data show that members of the HSFA1 group not only play a pivotal role in HSR but also are involved in growth and development. Alterations in morphology and retardation in growth were observed in the quadruple but not in triple KO mutants. The basal and acquired thermotolerance capacity was dramatically decreased in the QK mutant but varied in triple KO mutants at different developmental stages. The transcriptomics profiles suggested that more than 65\% of the heat stress (HS)-up-regulated genes were HSFA1 dependent. HSFA1s were also involved in the expression of several HS genes induced by H2O2, salt and mannitol, which is consistent with the increased sensitive phenotype of the QK mutant to the stress factors. In conclusion, the Arabidopsis HSFA1s function as the master regulators of HSR and participate as important components in other abiotic stress responses as well.},

Heat stress factors (HSFs) are a class of transcription factors that are synthesized rapidly in response to elevations in temperature and are responsible for the transcription of many heat stress-responsive genes including those encoding heat shock proteins (HSPs). There are 21 HSFs in Arabidopsis, and recent studies have established that the HSFA1 family members are master regulators for the remaining HSFs. However, very little is known about upstream molecular factors that control the expression of HSFA1 genes and other HSF genes under heat stress. Through a forward genetic analysis, we identified RCF3, a K homology (KH) domain-containing nuclear-localized putative RNA-binding protein. RCF3 is a negative regulator of most HSFs, including HSFA1a, HSFA1b, and HSFA1d. In contrast, RCF3 positively controls the expression of HSFA1e, HSFA3, HSFA9, HSFB3, and DREB2C. Consistently with the overall increased accumulation of heat-responsive genes, the rcf3 mutant plants are more tolerant than the wild-type to heat stress. Together, our results suggest that a KH domain-containing putative RNA-binding protein RCF3 is an important upstream regulator for heat stress-responsive gene expression and thermotolerance in Arabidopsis.},

Hsp70 proteins have been linked with basal heat tolerance in plants. Hsp101 likewise is an important chaperone protein that plays a critical role in heat tolerance in plants. We observed that Arabidopsis hsc70-1 mutant seedlings show elevated basal heat tolerance compared with wild-type. Over-expression of Hsc70-1 resulted in increased heat sensitivity. Hsp101 transcript and protein levels were increased during non-heat stress (HS) and post-HS conditions in hsc70-1 mutant seedlings. In contrast, Hsp101 was repressed in Hsc70-1 over-expressing plants after post-HS conditions. Hsc70-1 showed physical interaction with HsfA1d and HsfA1e protein in the cytosol under non-HS conditions. In transient reporter gene analysis, HsfA1d, HsfA1e and HsfA2 showed transcriptional response on the Hsp101 promoter. HsfA1d and HsfA2 transcripts were at higher levels in hsc70-1 mutant compared with wild-type. We provide genetic evidence that Hsc70-1 is a negative regulator affecting HsfA1d/A1e/A2 activators, which in turn regulate Hsp101 expression and basal thermotolerance.},

	abstract = {Improved drought tolerance is always a highly desired trait for agricultural plants. Significantly increased drought tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana (Columbia-0) has been achieved in our work through the suppression of ESKMO1 (ESK1) gene expression with small-interfering RNA (siRNA) and overexpression of CBF genes with constitutive gene expression. ESK1 has been identified as a gene linked to normal development of the plant vascular system, which is assumed directly related to plant drought response. By using siRNA that specifically targets ESK1, the gene expression has been reduced and drought tolerance of the plant has been enhanced dramatically in the work. However, the plant response to external abscisic acid application has not been changed. ICE1, CBF1, and CBF3 are genes involved in a well-characterized plant stress response pathway, overexpression of them in the plant has demonstrated capable to increase drought tolerance. By overexpression of these genes combining together with suppression of ESK1 gene, the significant increase of plant drought tolerance has been achieved in comparison to single gene manipulation, although the effect is not in an additive way. Accompanying the increase of drought tolerance via suppression of ESK1 gene expression, the negative effect has been observed in seeds yield of transgenic plants in normal watering conditions comparing with wide type plant.},

Stress metabolic markers were found to be among the most significant metabolic markers associated with the mutation, but also compounds related to growth regulation or nutrition. The metabolic phenotype of esk1 was also compared to that of wild type (WT) under various environmental constraints, namely cold, salinity and dehydration. The mutant was shown to express constitutively a subset of metabolic responses which fits with the core of stress metabolic responses in the WT. But remarkably, the most specific metabolic responses to cold acclimation were not phenocopied by esk1 mutation and remained fully inducible in the mutant at low temperature. Under salt stress, esk1 accumulated lower amounts of Na+ in leaves than the WT, and under dehydration stress its metabolic profile and osmotic potential were only slightly impacted. These phenotypes are consistent with the hypothesis of an altered water status in esk1, which actually exhibited basic lower water content (WC) and transpiration rate (TR) than the WT. Taken together, the results suggest that ESK1 does not function as a specific cold acclimation gene, but could rather be involved in water homeostasis.},

Here we show that the increase in freezing tolerance is not associated with any increase in the ability to survive drought or salt stresses, which are similar to freezing in their induction of cellular dehydration. Genome-wide comparisons of gene expression between esk1-1 and wild type indicate that mutations at esk1 result in altered expression of transcription factors and signaling components and of a set of stress-responsive genes. Interestingly, the list of 312 genes regulated by ESK1 shows greater overlap with sets of genes regulated by salt, osmotic and abscisic acid treatments than with genes regulated by cold acclimation or by the transcription factors CBF3 and ICE1, which have been shown to control genetic pathways for freezing tolerance. Map-based cloning identified the esk1 locus as At3g55990. The wild-type ESK1 gene encodes a 57-kDa protein and is a member of a large gene family of DUF231 domain proteins whose members encode a total of 45 proteins of unknown function. Our results indicate that ESK1 is a novel negative regulator of cold acclimation. Mutations in the ESK1 gene provide strong freezing tolerance through genetic regulation that is apparently very different from previously described genetic mechanisms of cold acclimation.},

In this article, we describe that the three members of the AtHOP family display a different induction pattern under heat, being HOP3 highly regulated during the challenge and the attenuation period. Despite HOP3 is the most heat-regulated member, the analysis of the hop1 hop2 hop3 triple mutant demonstrates that the three HOP proteins act redundantly to promote long-term acquired thermotolerance in Arabidopsis. HOPs interact strongly with HSP90 and part of the bulk of HOPs shuttles from the cytoplasm to the nuclei and to cytoplasmic foci during the challenge. RNAseq analyses demonstrate that, although the expression of the Hsf targets is not generally affected, the transcriptional response to heat is drastically altered during the acclimation period in the hop1 hop2 hop3 triple mutant. This mutant also displays an unusual high accumulation of insoluble and ubiquitinated proteins under heat, which highlights the additional role of HOP in protein quality control. These data reveal that HOP family is involved in different aspects of the response to heat, affecting the plant capacity to acclimate to high temperatures for long periods.},

However, the possible role of HOP during the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and the identity of its interactors within the ER were not previously addressed in any eukaryote. We have demonstrated that Arabidopsis HOP3, whose function was not studied before, interacts in vivo with cytosolic HSP90 and HSP70, and, unexpectedly, with binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), a HSP70 ER-resident protein. Although BiP lacks the domain described in other eukaryotes for HOP-HSP70 binding, it interacts with HOP3 through a non-canonical association to its nucleotide binding domain. Consistent with this interaction with BiP, HOP3 is partially localized at the ER. Moreover, HOP3 is induced both at transcript and protein levels by unfolded protein response (UPR) inducer agents by a mechanism dependent on inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). Importantly, hop3 loss-of-function mutants show a reduction in pollen germination and a hypersensitive phenotype in the presence of ER stress inducer agents, a phenotype that is reverted by the addition of the chemical chaperone tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). All these data demonstrate, for the first time in any eukaryote, a main role of HOP as an important regulator of the ER stress response, a process intimately linked in plants to important specific developmental programs and to environmental stress sensing and response.},

We searched for downstream genes in transgenic plants overexpressing DREB1A using the full-length cDNA microarray and Affymetrix GeneChip array.

Many of the products of these genes were proteins known to function against stress and were probably responsible for the stress tolerance of the transgenic plants. The downstream genes also included genes for protein factors involved in further regulation of signal transduction and gene expression in response to stress. The identified genes were classified into direct downstream genes of DREB1A and the others based on their expression patterns in response to cold stress.

We present a comprehensive statistical analysis of the genome-wide changes of gene expression in response to 14 d of cold acclimation in Arabidopsis, and provide a large-scale validation of these data by comparing datasets obtained for the Affymetrix ATH1 Genechip and MWG 50-mer oligonucleotide whole-genome microarrays.

            To understand the gene network controlling tolerance to cold stress, we performed an Arabidopsis thaliana genome transcript expression profile using Affymetrix GeneChips that contain ∼24,000 genes. We statistically determined 939 cold-regulated genes with 655 upregulated and 284 downregulated. A large number of early cold-responsive genes encode transcription factors that likely control late-responsive genes, suggesting a multitude of transcriptional cascades. In addition, many genes involved in chromatin level and posttranscriptional regulation were also cold regulated, suggesting their involvement in cold-responsive gene regulation. A number of genes important for the biosynthesis or signaling of plant hormones, such as abscisic acid, gibberellic acid, and auxin, are regulated by cold stress, which is of potential importance in coordinating cold tolerance with growth and development. We compared the cold-responsive transcriptomes of the wild type and inducer of CBF expression 1 (ice1), a mutant defective in an upstream transcription factor required for chilling and freezing tolerance. The transcript levels of many cold-responsive genes were altered in the ice1 mutant not only during cold stress but also before cold treatments. Our study provides a global picture of the Arabidopsis cold-responsive transcriptome and its control by ICE1 and will be valuable for understanding gene regulation under cold stress and the molecular mechanisms of cold tolerance.},

	abstract = {The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates many stress-related processes in plants. In this context ABA mediates the responsiveness of plants to environmental stresses such as drought, cold or salt. In response to water stress, ABA induces stomatal closure by activating Ca2+, K+ and anion channels in guard cells. To understand the signalling pathways that regulate these turgor control elements, we studied the transcriptional control of the K+ release channel gene GORK that is expressed in guard cells, roots and vascular tissue. GORK transcription was up-regulated upon onset of drought, salt stress and cold. The wilting hormone ABA that integrates responses to these stimuli induced GORK expression in seedlings in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and this induction was dependent on extracellular Ca2+. ABA-responsive expression of GORK was impaired in the ABA-insensitive mutants abi1-1 and abi2-1, indicating that these protein phosphatases are regulators of GORK expression. Application of ABA to suspension-cultured cells for 2 min followed by a 4 h chase was sufficient to manifest transcriptional activation of the K+ channel gene. As predicted for a process involved in drought adaptation, only 12–24 h after the release of the stress hormone, GORK mRNA slowly decreased. In contrast to other tissues, GORK expression as well as K+ out channel activity in guard cells is ABA insensitive, allowing the plant to adjust stomatal movement and water status control separately.},

	abstract = {The nucleus is the subcellular organelle that contains nearly all the genetic information required for the regulated expression of cellular proteins. In this study, we comprehensively characterized the Arabidopsis nuclear proteome. Nuclear proteins were isolated and analyzed using two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Approximately 500–700 spots were detected in reference 2D gels of nuclear proteins. Proteomic analyses led to the identification of 184 spots corresponding to 158 different proteins implicated in a variety of cellular functions. We additionally analyzed the changes in the nuclear proteome in response to cold stress. Of the 184 identified proteins, 54 were up- or downregulated with a greater than twofold change in response to cold treatment. Among these, six proteins were selected for further characterization. Northern analysis data revealed that gene expression of these proteins was also altered by cold stress. Following transient expression in BY-2 protoplasts, two proteins were detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus and four others were detected exclusively in the nucleus, which correlates well with the nuclear localization patterns of the proteomic data. Our study provides an initial insight into the Arabidopsis nuclear proteome and its response to cold stress.},

A group of B-box (BBX) proteins play critical roles in this developmental process through diverse regulatory mechanisms. In this study we report that BBX29 acts as a negative regulator of light signaling. BBX29 interacts with CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) and undergoes COP1-mediated degradation in the dark. Mutant seedlings with loss of BBX29 function show shortened hypocotyls, while transgenic plants overexpressing BBX29 display elongated hypocotyls in the light. Both BBX28 and BBX29 interfere with the binding of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) to the promoters of BBX30 and BBX31, consequently leading to the upregulation of their transcript levels. BBX30 and BBX31 associate with the promoter regions of BBX28 and BBX29, which in turn promotes the expression of these genes. Taken together, this study reveals a transcriptional feedback loop consisting of BBX28, BBX29, BBX30, BBX31, and HY5 that serves to fine-tune photomorphogenesis in response to light in plants.},

In Arabidopsis, 32 BBX proteins have been identified and classified into five groups based on their structural domains. Little is known about the fifth group members (BBX26–BBX32) and the detailed molecular mechanisms relevant to their functions. Here we identified B-box transcription factor 28 (BBX28) that interacts with Constans (CO), a transcriptional activator of Flowering Locus T (FT). Overexpressing BBX28 leads to late flowering with dramatically decreased FT transcription, and bbx28 deficient mutant displays a weak early flowering phenotype under long days (LD), indicating that BBX28 plays a negative and redundant role in flowering under LD. Additionally, the interaction between BBX28 and CO decreases the recruitment of CO to FT locus without affecting the transcriptional activation activity of CO. Moreover, the N-terminal cysteines, especially those within the B-box domain, are indispensable for the heterodimerization between BBX28 and CO and activation of CO on FT transcription. Genetic evidences show that the later flowering caused by BBX28 overexpression is compromised by CO ectopic expression. Collectively, these results supported that BBX28 functions with CO and FT to negatively regulate Arabidopsis flowering, in which the N-terminal conserved cysteines of BBX28 might play a central role.},

	abstract = {To identify genes of potential importance to cold, salt, and drought tolerance, global expression profiling was performed on Arabidopsis plants subjected to stress treatments of 4°C, 100 mm NaCl, or 200 mm mannitol, respectively. RNA samples were collected separately from leaves and roots after 3- and 27-h stress treatments. Profiling was conducted with a GeneChip microarray with probe sets for approximately 8,100 genes. Combined results from all three stresses identified 2,409 genes with a greater than 2-fold change over control. This suggests that about 30\% of the transcriptome is sensitive to regulation by common stress conditions. The majority of changes were stimulus specific. At the 3-h time point, less than 5\% (118 genes) of the changes were observed as shared by all three stress responses. By 27 h, the number of shared responses was reduced more than 10-fold (\&lt; 0.5\%), consistent with a progression toward more stimulus-specific responses. Roots and leaves displayed very different changes. For example, less than 14\% of the cold-specific changes were shared between root and leaves at both 3 and 27 h. The gene with the largest induction under all three stress treatments was At5g52310 (LTI/COR78), with induction levels in roots greater than 250-fold for cold, 40-fold for mannitol, and 57-fold for NaCl. A stress response was observed for 306 (68\%) of the known circadian controlled genes, supporting the hypothesis that an important function of the circadian clock is to “anticipate” predictable stresses such as cold nights. Although these results identify hundreds of potentially important transcriptome changes, the biochemical functions of many stress-regulated genes remain unknown.},

	abstract = {As rapid changes in climate threaten global crop yields, an understanding of plant heat stress tolerance is increasingly relevant. Heat stress tolerance involves the coordinated action of many cellular processes and is particularly energy demanding. We acquired a knockout mutant and generated knockdown lines in Arabidopsis thaliana of the d subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase (gene name: ATPQ, AT3G52300, referred to hereafter as ATPd), a subunit of the peripheral stalk, and used these to investigate the phenotypic significance of this subunit in normal growth and heat stress tolerance. Homozygous knockout mutants for ATPd could not be obtained due to gametophytic defects, while heterozygotes possess no visible phenotype. Therefore, we used RNA interference to create knockdown plant lines for further studies. Proteomic analysis and blue native gels revealed that ATPd downregulation impairs only subunits of the mitochondrial ATP synthase (complex V). Knockdown plants were more sensitive to heat stress, had abnormal leaf morphology, and were severely slow growing compared to wild type. These results indicate that ATPd plays a crucial role in proper function of the mitochondrial ATP synthase holoenzyme, which, when reduced, leads to wide-ranging defects in energy-demanding cellular processes. In knockdown plants, more hydrogen peroxide accumulated and mitochondrial dysfunction stimulon (MDS) genes were activated. These data establish the essential structural role of ATPd and support the importance of complex V in normal plant growth, and provide new information about its requirement for heat stress tolerance.},

To understand how the stroma and the lumen proteomes adapt to low temperatures, we have taken a proteomic approach (difference gel electrophoresis) to identify proteins that changed in abundance in Arabidopsis chloroplasts during cold shock (1 day), and short- (10 days) and long-term (40 days) acclimation to 5°C. We show that cold shock (1 day) results in minimal change in the plastid proteomes, while short-term (10 days) acclimation results in major changes in the stromal but few changes in the lumen proteome. Long-term acclimation (40 days) results in modulation of the proteomes of both compartments, with new proteins appearing in the lumen and further modulations in protein abundance occurring in the stroma. We identify 43 differentially displayed proteins that participate in photosynthesis, other plastid metabolic functions, hormone biosynthesis and stress sensing and signal transduction. These findings not only provide new insights into the cold response and acclimation of Arabidopsis, but also demonstrate the importance of studying changes in protein abundance within the relevant cellular compartment.},

Comparative transcriptome (RNA-Seq) and co-expression analysis of Col-0, mbf1c, and jub1 pointed to an involvement of genes encoding thermoswitches, cell wall remodelers, ABC-transporters, and H+-ATPases in regulating the deacclimation rate. In mbf1c and jub1, unique increases of stress-responsive genes and genes involved in jasmonic acid regulation were detected and linked to freezing tolerance retention during deacclimation. Data of this study are in agreement with previous observations of hypoxic niches within the plants and connected effects on growth and development during deacclimation. Regulation of deacclimation was shown to be a complex process, finely tuned to achieve an optimal rate and onset of deacclimation in plants.

For instance, moderate heat stress (HS) primes a plant to acquire thermotolerance, which allows subsequent survival of more severe HS conditions. Acquired thermotolerance is actively maintained over several days (HS memory) and involves the sustained induction of memory-related genes. Here we show that FORGETTER3/ HEAT SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR A3 (FGT3/HSFA3) is specifically required for physiological HS memory and maintaining high memory-gene expression during the days following a HS exposure. HSFA3 mediates HS memory by direct transcriptional activation of memory-related genes after return to normal growth temperatures. HSFA3 binds HSFA2, and in vivo both proteins form heteromeric complexes with additional HSFs. Our results indicate that only complexes containing both HSFA2 and HSFA3 efficiently promote transcriptional memory by positively influencing histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) hyper-methylation. In summary, our work defines the major HSF complex controlling transcriptional memory and elucidates the in vivo dynamics of HSF complexes during somatic stress memory., Moderate heat stress primes plants to acquire tolerance to subsequent, more severe heat stress. Here the authors show that the HSFA3 transcription factor forms a heteromeric complex with HSFA2 to sustain activated transcription of genes required for acquired thermotolerance by promoting H3K4 hyper-methylation.},

By structural characteristics and phylogenetic comparison, the 21 representatives are assigned to 3 classes and 14 groups. Particularly striking is the finding of a new class of Hsfs (AtHsfC1) closely related to Hsf1 from rice and to Hsfs identified from frequently found expressed sequence tags of tomato, potato, barley, and soybean. Evidently, this new type of Hsf is well expressed in different plant tissues. Besides the DNA binding and oligomerization domains (HR-A/B region), we identified other functional modules of Arabidopsis Hsfs by sequence comparison with the well-characterized tomato Hsfs. These are putative motifs for nuclear import and export and transcriptional activation (AHA motifs). There is intriguing flexibility of size and sequence in certain parts of the otherwise strongly conserved N-terminal half of these Hsfs. We have speculated about possible exon-intron borders in this region in the ancient precursor gene of plant Hsfs, similar to the exon-intron structure of the present mammalian Hsf-encoding genes.},

	abstract = {The dehydration-responsive element binding protein (DREB)/C-repeat binding factor (CBF) family are the classical transcriptional regulators involved in plant responses to drought, salt and cold stress. Recently it was demonstrated that DREB2A is induced by heat stress (hs) and is a regulator of the hs response of Arabidopsis. Here we provide molecular insights into the regulation and function of hs transcription factor HsfA3. Among the 21 members of the Arabidopsis Hsf family, HsfA3 is the only Hsf that is transcriptionally induced during hs by DREB2A, and HsfA3 in turn regulates the expression of Hsp-encoding genes. This transcription factor cascade was reconstructed in transient GUS reporter assays in mesophyll protoplasts by showing that DREB2A could activate the HsfA3 promoter, whereas HsfA3 in turn was shown to be a potent activator on the promoters of Hsp genes. Direct binding to the corresponding promoters was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and the involvement of HsfA3 in the hs response in vivo was shown directly by observation of reduced thermotolerance in HsfA3 mutant lines. Altogether these data demonstrate that HsfA3 is transcriptionally controlled by DREB2A and important for the establishment of thermotolerance.},

In the current study, we characterized the activity of the Hsf gene HsfA3 in Arabidopsis under oxidative stress conditions. HsfA3 transcription in seedlings was induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS), exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and an endogenous H2O2 propagator, 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone (DBMIB). HsfA3-overexpressing transgenic plants exhibited increased oxidative stress tolerance compared to untransformed wild-type plants (WT), as revealed by changes in fresh weight, chlorophyll fluorescence, and ion leakage under light conditions. The expression of several genes encoding galactinol synthase (GolS), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs), which function as antioxidants in plant cells, was induced in HsfA3 overexpressors. In addition, galactinol levels were higher in HsfA3 overexpressors than in WT under unstressed conditions. In transient transactivation assays using Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts, HsfA3 activated the transcription of a reporter gene driven by the GolS1 or GolS2 promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that GolS1 and GolS2 are directly regulated by HsfA3. Taken together, these findings provide evidence that GolS1 and GolS2 are directly regulated by HsfA3 and that GolS enzymes play an important role in improving oxidative stress tolerance by increasing galactinol biosynthesis in Arabidopsis.},

            Changes in intracellular calcium (Ca2+) levels serve to signal responses to diverse stimuli. Ca2+ signals are likely perceived through proteins that bind Ca2+, undergo conformation changes following Ca2+ binding, and interact with target proteins. The 50-member calmodulin-like (CML) Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) family encodes proteins containing the predicted Ca2+-binding EF-hand motif. The functions of virtually all these proteins are unknown. CML24, also known as TCH2, shares over 40\% amino acid sequence identity with calmodulin, has four EF hands, and undergoes Ca2+-dependent changes in hydrophobic interaction chromatography and migration rate through denaturing gel electrophoresis, indicating that CML24 binds Ca2+ and, as a consequence, undergoes conformational changes. CML24 expression occurs in all major organs, and transcript levels are increased from 2- to 15-fold in plants subjected to touch, darkness, heat, cold, hydrogen peroxide, abscisic acid (ABA), and indole-3-acetic acid. However, CML24 protein accumulation changes were not detectable. The putative CML24 regulatory region confers reporter expression at sites of predicted mechanical stress; in regions undergoing growth; in vascular tissues and various floral organs; and in stomata, trichomes, and hydathodes. CML24-underexpressing transgenics are resistant to ABA inhibition of germination and seedling growth, are defective in long-day induction of flowering, and have enhanced tolerance to CoCl2, molybdic acid, ZnSO4, and MgCl2. MgCl2 tolerance is not due to reduced uptake or to elevated Ca2+ accumulation. Together, these data present evidence that CML24, a gene expressed in diverse organs and responsive to diverse stimuli, encodes a potential Ca2+ sensor that may function to enable responses to ABA, daylength, and presence of various salts.},

Novel discoveries


CML24 has differences in sequence to CaM which suggest a different target preference.


CML24 has high Ca2+ affinity and undergoes profound Ca2+-induced conformational changes.


Expression of CML24 increases upon perception of cold, and this requires Ca2+ channel activity = CML24 up-regulation by cold is Ca2+ dependent.


CML24 protein levels do not change upon perception of cold.


It could be that nascent CML24 transcripts are not translated, but it may be more plausible that new protein synthesis is not detected by the methods used here. It is also possible that new synthesis replaces degraded protein…




CML24 is expressed in all major organs, but especially guard cells and vascular tissue.


CML24-underexpressing mutants have delayed flowering at 16- and 24-h photoperiods. Based on its phenotype it is likely that CML24 is required for photoperiod-induced flowering.

Here, we report that a specifically cold-induced nuclear protein, Tolerant to Chilling and Freezing 1 (TCF1), interacts with histones H3 and H4 and associates with chromatin containing a target gene, BLUE-COPPER-BINDING PROTEIN (BCB), encoding a glycosylphosphatidylinositolanchored protein that regulates lignin biosynthesis. Loss of TCF1 function leads to reduced BCB transcription through affecting H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 levels within the BCB gene, resulting in reduced lignin content and enhanced freezing tolerance. Furthermore, plants with knocked-down BCB expression (amiRNA-BCB) under cold acclimation had reduced lignin accumulation and increased freezing tolerance. The pal1pal2 double mutant (lignin content reduced by 30\% compared with WT) also showed the freezing tolerant phenotype, and TCF1 and BCB act upstream of PALs to regulate lignin content. In addition, TCF1 acts independently of the CBF (C-repeat binding factor) pathway. Our findings delineate a novel molecular pathway linking the TCF1-mediated cold-specific transcriptional program to lignin biosynthesis, thus achieving cell wall remodeling with increased freezing tolerance.},

We have studied three genotypes: Col-0; a fum2 mutant in a Col-0 background; and C24, an accession with reduced FUM2 expression. While low temperature causes an increase in Pmax in the Col-0 plants, this parameter decreases following exposure of plants to 30 °C for 7 d. Plants in which fumarate accumulation is partially (C24) or completely (fum2) abolished show a reduced acclimation of Pmax across the physiological temperature range (i.e. Pmax changes less in response to changing temperature). To understand the role of fumarate accumulation, we have adapted a reliability engineering technique, Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), to formalize a rigorous approach for ranking metabolites according to the potential risk that they pose to the metabolic system. FMEA identifies fumarate as a low-risk metabolite, while its precursor, malate, is shown to be high risk and liable to cause system instability. We propose that the role of FUM2 is to provide a fail-safe in order to control malate concentration, maintaining system stability in a changing environment. We suggest that FMEA is a technique that is not only useful in understanding plant metabolism but can also be used to study reliability in other systems and synthetic pathways.},

	abstract = {Photosynthesis is especially sensitive to environmental conditions, and the composition of the photosynthetic apparatus can be modulated in response to environmental change, a process termed photosynthetic acclimation. Previously, we identified a role for a cytosolic fumarase, FUM2 in acclimation to low temperature in Arabidopsis thaliana. Mutant lines lacking FUM2 were unable to acclimate their photosynthetic apparatus to cold. Here, using gas exchange measurements and metabolite assays of acclimating and non-acclimating plants, we show that acclimation to low temperature results in a change in the distribution of photosynthetically fixed carbon to different storage pools during the day. Proteomic analysis of wild-type Col-0 Arabidopsis and of a fum2 mutant, which was unable to acclimate to cold, indicates that extensive changes occurring in response to cold are affected in the mutant. Metabolic and proteomic data were used to parameterize metabolic models. Using an approach called flux sampling, we show how the relative export of triose phosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate provides a signal of the chloroplast redox state that could underlie photosynthetic acclimation to cold.},

	abstract = {The Arabidopsis genome has two fumarase genes, one of which encodes a protein with mitochondrial targeting information (FUM1) while the other (FUM2) does not. We show that a FUM1–green fluorescent protein fusion is directed to mitochondria while FUM2–red fluorescent protein remains in the cytosol. While mitochondrial FUM1 is an essential gene, cytosolic FUM2 is not required for plant growth. However FUM2 is required for the massive accumulation of carbon into fumarate that occurs in Arabidopsis leaves during the day. In fum2 knock-out mutants, fumarate levels remain low while malate increases, and these changes can be reversed with a FUM2 transgene. The fum2 mutant has lower levels of many amino acids in leaves during the day compared with the wild type, but higher levels at night, consistent with a link between fumarate and amino acid metabolism. To further test this relationship we grew plants in the absence or presence of nitrogen fertilizer. The amount of fumarate in leaves increased several fold in response to nitrogen in wild-type plants, but not in fum2. Malate increased to a small extent in the wild type but to a greater extent in fum2. Growth of fum2 plants was similar to that of the wild type in low nitrogen but much slower in the presence of high nitrogen. Activities of key enzymes of nitrogen assimilation were similar in both genotypes. We conclude that FUM2 is required for the accumulation of fumarate in leaves, which is in turn required for rapid nitrogen assimilation and growth on high nitrogen.},

	abstract = {Basal thermotolerance is very important for plant growth and development when plants are subjected to heat stress. However, little is known about the functional mechanism of gibberellins (GAs) in the basal thermotolerance of plants. In the present work, we provide molecular evidence that a member of the gene family encoding the GA-stimulated Arabidopsis (GASA) peptides, namely GASA5, is involved in the regulation of seedling thermotolerance. The GASA5-overexpressing plants displayed a weak thermotolerance, with a faster cotyledon-yellowing rate, lower seedling-survival rate, and slower hypocotyl elongation, in comparison to the wild-type and GASA5 null-mutant (gasa5-1) plants, after heat-stress treatment. The short-hypocotyl phenotype of GASA5-overexpressing plants could be rescued by the exogenous application of salicylic acid (SA), the hormone found to protect plants from heat stress-induced damage. GASA5 expression was inhibited by heat stress but unaffected by the application of exogenous SA. However, expression of the gene encoding the noexpresser of PR genes 1 (NPR1), a key component of the SA-signaling pathway, was downregulated by GASA5 overexpression. Importantly, when different GASA5-genotype plants were treated with heat stress, several genes encoding heat-shock proteins, including HSP101, HSP70B, HSP90.1, HSP17.6-C1, and HSP60, were inhibited by GASA5 overexpression. Meanwhile, hydrogen peroxide was accumulated at high levels in heat stress-treated GASA5-overexpressing plants. These results suggest that the Arabidopsis GASA5 gene acts as a negative regulator in thermotolerance by regulating both SA signaling and heat shock-protein accumulation.},

In the present work, we provide clear genetic evidence that GASA5, a GASA family gene in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), is involved in controlling flowering time and stem growth. GASA5 expression was present in all tissues of Arabidopsis plants, as detected by RT-PCR, and robust GUS staining was observed in the shoot apex of 8-day-old seedlings and inflorescence meristems during reproductive development. Phenotypic analysis showed that a GASA5 null mutant (gasa5-1) flowered earlier than wild type with a faster stem growth rate under both long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) photoperiods. In contrast, transgenic plants overexpressing GASA5 demonstrated delayed flowering, with a slower stem growth rate compared to wild-type plants. However, neither the GASA5 null mutants nor the GASA5 overexpressing plants revealed obvious differences in flowering time upon treatment with gibberellic acid (GA3), indicating that GASA5 is involved in gibberellin (GA)-promoted flowering. GAI (GA INSENSITIVE), one of the five DELLAs in Arabidopsis, was more highly expressed in GASA5-overexpressing plants, but it was lower in gasa5-1. Further transcript profiling analysis suggested that GASA5 delayed flowering by enhancing FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) expression and repressing the expression of key flowering-time genes, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and LEAFY (LFY). Our results suggest that GASA5 is a negative regulator of GA-induced flowering and stem growth.},

Although exocytic vesicle trafficking plays an important role in recycling the PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin efflux carriers and in polar auxin transport during lateral root formation, the mechanistic details of these processes are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that BYPASS1-LIKE (B1L) regulates lateral root initiation via exocytic vesicular trafficking-mediated PIN recycling in Arabidopsis thaliana. b1l mutants contained significantly more lateral roots than the wild type, primarily due to increased lateral root primordium initiation. Furthermore, the auxin signal was stronger in stage I lateral root primordia of b1l than in those of the wild type. Treatment with exogenous auxin and an auxin transport inhibitor indicated that the lateral root phenotype of b1l could be attributed to higher auxin levels and that B1L regulates auxin efflux. Indeed, compared to the wild type, C-terminally green fluorescent protein-tagged PIN1 and PIN3 accumulated at higher levels in b1l lateral root primordia. B1L interacted with the exocyst, and b1l showed defective PIN exocytosis. These observations indicate that B1L interacts with the exocyst to regulate PIN-mediated polar auxin transport and lateral root initiation in Arabidopsis.},

The current study reports that sub-ambient CO2 up-regulated the low temperature induction of the C-repeat Binding Factor (CBF)-dependent cold signaling pathway in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and the opposite occurred in response to supra-ambient CO2. Accordingly, cold induction of various downstream cold-responsive genes was modified by CO2 treatments and expression changes were either partially or fully CBF-dependent. Changes in electrolyte leakage during freezing tests were correlated with CO2′s effects on CBF expression. Cold treatments were also performed on Arabidopsis mutants with altered stomatal responses to CO2, i.e., high leaf temperature 1-2 (ht1-2, CO2 hypersensitive) and β-carbonic anhydrase 1 and 4 (ca1ca4, CO2 insensitive). The cold-induced expression of CBF and downstream CBF target genes plus freezing tolerance of ht1-2 was consistently less than that for Col-0, suggesting that HT1 is a positive modulator of cold signaling. The ca1ca4 mutant had diminished CBF expression during cold treatment but the downstream expression of cold-responsive genes was either similar to or greater than that of Col-0. This finding suggested that βCA1/4 modulates the expression of certain cold-responsive genes in a CBF-independent manner. Stomatal conductance measurements demonstrated that low temperatures overrode low CO2-induced stomatal opening and this process was delayed in the cold tolerant mutant, ca1ca4, compared to the cold sensitive mutant, ht1-2. The similar stomatal responses were evident from freezing tolerant line, Ox-CBF, overexpression of CBF3, compared to wild-type ecotype Ws-2. Together, these results indicate that CO2 signaling in stomata and CBF-mediated cold signaling work coordinately in Arabidopsis to manage abiotic stress.},

To understand how the stroma and the lumen proteomes adapt to low temperatures, we have taken a proteomic approach (difference gel electrophoresis) to identify proteins that changed in abundance in Arabidopsis chloroplasts during cold shock (1 day), and short- (10 days) and long-term (40 days) acclimation to 5°C. We show that cold shock (1 day) results in minimal change in the plastid proteomes, while short-term (10 days) acclimation results in major changes in the stromal but few changes in the lumen proteome. Long-term acclimation (40 days) results in modulation of the proteomes of both compartments, with new proteins appearing in the lumen and further modulations in protein abundance occurring in the stroma. We identify 43 differentially displayed proteins that participate in photosynthesis, other plastid metabolic functions, hormone biosynthesis and stress sensing and signal transduction. These findings not only provide new insights into the cold response and acclimation of Arabidopsis, but also demonstrate the importance of studying changes in protein abundance within the relevant cellular compartment.},

	abstract = {Fructose (Fru) is a major storage form of sugars found in vacuoles, yet the molecular regulation of vacuolar Fru transport is poorly studied. Although SWEET17 (for SUGARS WILL EVENTUALLY BE EXPORTED TRANSPORTERS17) has been characterized as a vacuolar Fru exporter in leaves, its expression in leaves is low. Here, RNA analysis and SWEET17-β-glucuronidase/-GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN fusions expressed in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) reveal that SWEET17 is highly expressed in the cortex of roots and localizes to the tonoplast of root cells. Expression of SWEET17 in roots was inducible by Fru and darkness, treatments that activate accumulation and release of vacuolar Fru, respectively. Mutation and ectopic expression of SWEET17 led to increased and decreased root growth in the presence of Fru, respectively. Overexpression of SWEET17 specifically reduced the Fru content in leaves by 80\% during cold stress. These results intimate that SWEET17 functions as a Fru-specific uniporter on the root tonoplast. Vacuoles overexpressing SWEET17 showed increased [14C]Fru uptake compared with the wild type. SWEET17-mediated Fru uptake was insensitive to ATP or treatment with NH4Cl or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone, indicating that SWEET17 functions as an energy-independent facilitative carrier. The Arabidopsis genome contains a close paralog of SWEET17 in clade IV, SWEET16. The predominant expression of SWEET16 in root vacuoles and reduced root growth of mutants under Fru excess indicate that SWEET16 also functions as a vacuolar transporter in roots. We propose that in addition to a role in leaves, SWEET17 plays a key role in facilitating bidirectional Fru transport across the tonoplast of roots in response to metabolic demand to maintain cytosolic Fru homeostasis.},

The SWEET16 gene, similar to the homologs gene SWEET17, is mainly expressed in vascular parenchyma cells. Application of Glc, Fru, or Suc, as well as cold, osmotic stress, or low nitrogen, provoke the down-regulation of SWEET16 messenger RNA accumulation. SWEET16 overexpressors (35SPro:SWEET16) showed a number of peculiarities related to differences in sugar accumulation, such as less Glc, Fru, and Suc at the end of the night. Under cold stress, 35SPro:SWEET16 plants are unable to accumulate Fru, while under nitrogen starvation, both Glc and Fru, but not Suc, were less abundant. These changes of individual sugars indicate that the consequences of an increased SWEET16 activity are dependent upon the type of external stimulus. Remarkably, 35SPro:SWEET16 lines showed improved germination and increased freezing tolerance. The latter observation, in combination with the modified sugar levels, points to a superior function of Glc and Suc for frost tolerance. 35SPro:SWEET16 plants exhibited increased growth efficiency when cultivated on soil and showed improved nitrogen use efficiency when nitrate was sufficiently available, while under conditions of limiting nitrogen, wild-type biomasses were higher than those of 35SPro:SWEET16 plants. Our results identify SWEET16 as a vacuolar sugar facilitator, demonstrate the substantial impact of SWEET16 overexpression on various critical plant traits, and imply that SWEET16 activity must be tightly regulated to allow optimal Arabidopsis development under nonfavorable conditions.},

This study characterizes the interaction between a typical dehydrin (Lti30) and lipid membranes., Dehydrins are intrinsically disordered plant proteins whose expression is upregulated under conditions of desiccation and cold stress. Their molecular function in ensuring plant survival is not yet known, but several studies suggest their involvement in membrane stabilization. The dehydrins are characterized by a broad repertoire of conserved and repetitive sequences, out of which the archetypical K-segment has been implicated in membrane binding. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of these K-segments, we examined the interaction between lipid membranes and a dehydrin with a basic functional sequence composition: Lti30, comprising only K-segments. Our results show that Lti30 interacts electrostatically with vesicles of both zwitterionic (phosphatidyl choline) and negatively charged phospholipids (phosphatidyl glycerol, phosphatidyl serine, and phosphatidic acid) with a stronger binding to membranes with high negative surface potential. The membrane interaction lowers the temperature of the main lipid phase transition, consistent with Lti30’s proposed role in cold tolerance. Moreover, the membrane binding promotes the assembly of lipid vesicles into large and easily distinguishable aggregates. Using these aggregates as binding markers, we identify three factors that regulate the lipid interaction of Lti30 in vitro: (1) a pH dependent His on/off switch, (2) phosphorylation by protein kinase C, and (3) reversal of membrane binding by proteolytic digest.},

Mutating one of the three ACGT elements (ACGT1) increases expression in the absence of cold or ABA. An AT-rich element is a novel partner (coupling element) of ACGT-containing ABA-responsive cis-elements. A 12-bp palindrome also acts as a coupling element for ABA induction and includes one of the three dehydration-responsive element/C-repeat (DRE/CRT) elements and two overlapping motifs (TGTCG and TCGGC) previously shown to be statistically enriched in ABA-dependent and ‘VP1 or ABA’-dependent activated genes (Plant Physiol. 2005; 139:437). At least two of the DRE/CRT elements are required for significant cold induction. During cold induction the AT-rich element also functions as a coupling element and ACGT1 is involved in repressing this induction. Two of the ACGT and DRE/CRT elements overlap, and mutating a single base in the ACGT of either of the two GCCGACGT sequences while retaining a DRE element reduced both ABA and cold induction. Changing the spatial relationships between the elements by deletion, inversion or insertion of DNA sequences reduced both cold and ABA induction. Overexpression of CBF1, −2 or −3 induced XERO2 expression in untreated plants. The ABI5 transcription factor may have a role in ABA-induced XERO2 expression, whereas ABI3 and ABI4 do not. The GCA2 gene was essential for both cold and ABA induction. A combination of the same overlapping and shared elements is used in the regulation of transcription by ABA and cold.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Dehydrins are intrinsically disordered proteins, generally expressed in plants as a response to embryogenesis and water-related stress. Their suggested functions are in membrane stabilization and cell protection. All dehydrins contain at least one copy of the highly conserved K-segment, proposed to be a membrane-binding motif. The dehydrin Lti30 (\textit{Arabidopsis thaliana}) is up-regulated during cold and drought stress conditions and comprises six K-segments, each with two adjacent histidines. Lti30 interacts with the membrane electrostatically via pH-dependent protonation of the histidines. In this work, we seek a molecular understanding of the membrane interaction mechanism of Lti30 by determining the diffusion and molecular organization of Lti30 on model membrane systems by imaging total internal reflection– fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (ITIR-FCS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The dependence of the diffusion coefficient explored by ITIR-FCS together with MD simulations yields insights into Lti30 binding, domain partitioning, and aggregation. The effect of Lti30 on membrane lipid diffusion was studied on fluorescently labeled supported lipid bilayers of different lipid compositions at mechanistically important pH conditions. In parallel, we compared the mode of diffusion for short individual K-segment peptides. The results indicate that Lti30 binds the lipid bilayer via electrostatics, which restricts the mobility of lipids and bound protein molecules. At low pH, Lti30 binding induced lipid microdomain formation as well as protein aggregation, which could be correlated with one another. Moreover, at physiological pH, Lti30 forms nanoscale aggregates when proximal to the membrane suggesting that Lti30 may protect the cell by "cross-linking" the membrane lipids.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The molecular function and structural action of the dehydrins are yet elusive, but increasing evidence points to a role in protecting the structure and functional dynamics of cell membranes. An intriguing example is the cold-induced dehydrin Lti30 that binds to membranes by its conserved K segments. Moreover, this binding can be regulated by pH and phosphorylation and shifts the membrane phase transition to lower temperatures, consistent with the protein’s postulated function in cold stress. In this study, we reveal how the Lti30-membrane interplay works structurally at atomic level resolution in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis suggests that negatively charged lipid head groups electrostatically capture the protein’s disordered K segments, which locally fold up into α-helical segments on the membrane surface. Thus, Lti30 conforms to the general theme of structure-function relationships by folding upon binding, in spite of its disordered, atypically hydrophilic and repetitive sequence signatures. Moreover, the fixed and well-defined structure of the membrane-bound K segments suggests that dehydrins have the molecular prerequisites for higher level binding specificity and regulation, raising new questions about the complexity of their biological function.},

	abstract = {Background
With the advent of microarray technology, it has become feasible to identify virtually all genes in an organism that are induced by developmental or environmental changes. However, relying solely on gene expression data may be of limited value if the aim is to infer the underlying genetic networks. Development of computational methods to combine microarray data with other information sources is therefore necessary. Here we describe one such method.

Results
By means of our method, previously published Arabidopsis microarray data from cold acclimated plants at six different time points, promoter motif sequence data extracted from {\textasciitilde}24,000 Arabidopsis promoters and known transcription factor binding sites were combined to construct a putative genetic regulatory interaction network. The inferred network includes both previously characterised and hitherto un-described regulatory interactions between transcription factor (TF) genes and genes that encode other TFs or other proteins. Part of the obtained transcription factor regulatory network is presented here. More detailed information is available in the additional files.

Conclusion
The rule-based method described here can be used to infer genetic networks by combining data from microarrays, promoter sequences and known promoter binding sites. This method should in principle be applicable to any biological system. We tested the method on the cold acclimation process in Arabidopsis and could identify a more complex putative genetic regulatory network than previously described. However, it should be noted that information on specific binding sites for individual TFs were in most cases not available. Thus, gene targets for the entire TF gene families were predicted. In addition, the networks were built solely by a bioinformatics approach and experimental verifications will be necessary for their final validation. On the other hand, since our method highlights putative novel interactions, more directed experiments could now be performed.},

	abstract = {UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase) is a key enzyme producing UDP-glucose, which is involved in an array of metabolic pathways concerned with, among other functions, the synthesis of sucrose and cellulose. An Arabidopsis thaliana UGPase-encoding gene, Ugp, was profoundly up-regulated by feeding sucrose to the excised leaves and by an exposure of plants to low temperature (5 degrees C). The UGPase activity and its protein content also increased under conditions of sucrose feeding and exposure to cold. The sucrose effect on Ugp was apparently specific and was mimicked by exposure of dark-adapted leaves to light. Drought and O2 deficiency had some down-regulating effects on expression of Ugp. The sugar-signalling pathway for Ugp regulation was independent of hexokinase, as was found by using transgenic plants with increased and decreased expression of the corresponding gene. Subjecting mutants deficient in abscisic acid (ABA) to cold stress conditions had no effect on Ugp expression profiles. Okadaic acid was a powerful inhibitor of Ugp expression, whereas it up-regulated the gene encoding sucrose synthase (Sus1), indicating distinct transduction pathways in transmitting the sugar signal for the two genes in A. thaliana. We suggest that Ugp gene expression is mediated via a hexokinase-independent and ABA-insensitive pathway that involves an okadaic acid-responsive protein phosphatase. The data point towards Ugp as a possible regulatory entity that is closely involved in the homoeostatic readjustment of plant responses to environmental signals.},

Overexpression of DREB1A improves stress tolerance to both freezing and dehydration in transgenic plants. In contrast, overexpression of an active form of DREB2A results in significant stress tolerance to dehydration but only slight tolerance to freezing in transgenic plants. The downstream gene products for DREB1A and DREB2A are reported to have similar putative functions, but downstream genes encoding enzymes for carbohydrate metabolism are very different between DREB1A and DREB2A. We demonstrate that under cold and dehydration conditions, the expression of many genes encoding starch-degrading enzymes, sucrose metabolism enzymes, and sugar alcohol synthases changes dynamically; consequently, many kinds of monosaccharides, disaccharides, trisaccharides, and sugar alcohols accumulate in Arabidopsis. We also show that DREB1A overexpression can cause almost the same changes in these metabolic processes and that these changes seem to improve freezing and dehydration stress tolerance in transgenic plants. In contrast, DREB2A overexpression did not increase the level of any of these metabolites in transgenic plants. Strong freezing stress tolerance of the transgenic plants overexpressing DREB1A may depend on accumulation of these metabolites.},

A time-course transcript profiling analysis for cold shock at 4°C revealed that BMY8 (At4g17090) was induced specifically in response to cold shock, while major induction was not observed for any of the other eight beta-amylases. A parallel metabolite-profiling analysis revealed a robust transient maltose accumulation during cold shock. BMY8 RNAi lines with lower BMY8 expression exhibited a starch-excess phenotype, and a dramatic decrease in maltose accumulation during a 6-h cold shock at 4°C. The decreased maltose content was also accompanied by decreased glucose, fructose and sucrose content in the BMY8 RNAi plants, consistent with the roles of beta-amylase and maltose in transitory starch metabolism. BMY8 RNAi lines with reduced soluble sugar content exhibited diminished chlorophyll fluorescence as Fv/Fm ratio compared with wild type, suggesting that PSII photochemical efficiency was more sensitive to freezing stress. Together, carbohydrate analysis and freezing stress results of BMY8 RNAi lines indicate that increased maltose content, by itself or together through a maltose-dependent increase in other soluble sugars, contributes to the protection of the photosynthetic electron transport chain during freezing stress.},

Sucrose, glucose and fructose accumulation consumed 42\% of the carbon from A but leaf starch only could synthesize ∼10\% of observed changes in soluble sugars. Carbohydrates were the only major class of metabolites that accumulated during the first 24h of cold treatment. Except maltose and raffinose, carbohydrate accumulation was abolished when cold treatments were in darkness. Starch hydrolysis was correlated with maltose accumulation and increased expression of BAM3, which encodes a β-amylase necessary for starch mobilization. Hexose accumulation was delayed 6h and raffinose accumulation was not observed in a starchless (pgm1) mutant. Changes of expression of five stress-induced transcripts in response to cold were similar in the wild type and in the pgm1 mutant. Three of five stress related transcripts had decreased expression when cold treatments were performed in the dark compared to the light. Therefore, starch hydrolysis may augment hexose and raffinose accumulations during the first 24h after a cold shock and a partial cold stress response was observed in Arabidopsis during cold treatments in the dark.},

Although single-gene knockouts revealed the necessity of BAM3 for starch degradation, contributions of other BAMs are poorly understood. Moreover, it is not possible to detect the contribution of individual BAMs in plants containing multiple active BAMs. Therefore, we constructed a set of five quadruple mutants each expressing only one catalytically active BAM, and a quintuple mutant missing all of these BAMs (B-Null). Using these mutants, we assessed the influence of each individual BAM on plant growth and on leaf starch degradation. Both BAM1 and BAM3 alone support wild-type (WT) levels of growth. BAM3 alone is sufficient to degrade leaf starch completely whereas BAM1 alone can only partially degrade leaf starch. In contrast, BAM2, BAM5, and BAM6 have no detectable effect on starch degradation or plant growth, being comparable with the B-Null plants. B-Null plant extracts contained no measurable amylase activity, whereas BAM3 and BAM1 contributed about 70\% and 14\% of the WT activity, respectively. BAM2 activity was low but detectable and BAM6 contributed no measurable activity. Interestingly, activity of BAM1 and BAM3 in the mutants varied little developmentally or diurnally, and did not increase appreciably in response to osmotic or cold stress. With these genetic lines, we now have new opportunities to investigate members of this diverse gene family.},

Of nine Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) BAM genes, six encode plastidic enzymes, but only four of these are catalytically active. In vegetative plants, BAM1 acts during the day in guard cells, whereas BAM3 is the dominant activity in mesophyll cells at night. Plastidic BAMs have been difficult to assay in leaf extracts, in part because of a cytosolic activity encoded by BAM5. We generated a series of double mutants lacking BAM5 and each of the active plastidic enzymes (BAM1, BAM2, BAM3, and BAM6) and found that most of the plastidic activity in 5-week-old plants was encoded by BAM1 and BAM3. Both of these activities were relatively constant during the day and the night. Analysis of leaf extracts from double mutants and purified BAM1 and BAM3 proteins revealed that these proteins have distinct properties. Using soluble starch as the substrate, BAM1 and BAM3 had optimum activity at pH 6.0 to 6.5, but at high pH, BAM1 was more active than BAM3, consistent with its known daytime role in the guard cell stroma. The optimum temperature for BAM1, which is transcriptionally induced by heat stress, was about 10°C higher than that of BAM3, which is transcriptionally induced by cold stress. The amino acid composition of BAM1 and BAM3 orthologs reflected differences that are consistent with known adaptations of proteins from heat- and cold-adapted organisms, suggesting that these day- and night-active enzymes have undergone thermal adaptation.},

	abstract = {β-Amylase3 (BAM3) is an enzyme that is essential for starch degradation in plant leaves and is also transcriptionally induced under cold stress. However, we recently reported that BAM3’s enzymatic activity decreased in cold-stressed Arabidopsis leaves, although the activity of BAM1, a homologous leaf β-amylase, was largely unaffected. This decrease in BAM3 activity may relate to the accumulation of starch reported in cold-stressed plants. The aim of this study was to explore the disparity between BAM3 transcript and activity levels under cold stress, and we present evidence suggesting BAM3 is being inhibited by post-translational modification. A mechanism of enzyme inhibition was suggested by observing that BAM3 protein levels remained unchanged under cold stress. Cold stress induces nitric oxide (NO) signaling, one result being alteration of protein activity by nitrosylation or glutathionylation through agents such as S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). To test whether NO induction correlates with inhibition of BAM3 in vivo, plants were treated with sodium nitroprusside, which releases NO, and a decline in BAM3 but not BAM1 activity was again observed. Treatment of recombinant BAM3 and BAM1 with GSNO caused significant, dose-dependent inhibition of BAM3 activity while BAM1 was largely unaffected. Site-directed mutagenesis, anti-glutathione Western blots, and mass spectrometry were then used to determine that in vitro BAM3 inhibition was caused by glutathionylation at cysteine 433. In addition, we generated a BAM1 mutant resembling BAM3 that was sensitive to GSNO inhibition. These findings demonstrate a differential response of two BAM paralogs to the Cys-modifying reagent GSNO and provide a possible molecular basis for reduced BAM3 activity in cold-stressed plants.},

Understanding these environmental effects on starch metabolism has been difficult in the past because the pathways of transitory starch synthesis and degradation are not completely known. Over the past two years there has been a significant increase in our understanding of transitory starch breakdown. The discovery of a maltose transporter (MEX1) and the studies of a cytosolic disproportionating enzyme (D-enzyme, DPE2) confirmed that maltose is the predominant form of carbon exported from chloroplasts at night. Maltose increases in leaves when starch breakdown is induced during the day under photorespiratory conditions. Maltose metabolism is regulated by a circadian clock, day length and temperature. The expression of maltose-metabolizing genes shows a pronounced circadian rhythm indicating maltose metabolism is clock regulated. Indeed, the maltose level oscillates under continuous light. The transcript of a β-amylase gene (BAM3) peaks during the day in long days and peaks at night in short days. This could provide a mechanism for adjusting starch breakdown rates to day length. Under cold-stress conditions, maltose increases and BAM3 expression is induced. We hypothesize that maltose metabolism is a bridge between transitory starch breakdown and the plants’ adaptation to changes in environmental conditions.},

However, the mechanism through which photoreceptors regulate starch metabolism in chloroplasts is unclear. In this study, we found that the cryptochrome 1a (CRY1a)-mediated blue light signal is critical for regulating starch accumulation by inducing starch degradation through the transcription factor HY5 in chloroplasts in tomato. cry1a mutants and HY5-RNAi plants accumulated more starch and presented lower transcript levels of starch degradation-related genes in their leaves than wild-type plants. Blue light significantly induced the transcription of starch degradation-related genes in wild-type and CRY1a- or HY5-overexpressing plants but had little effect in cry1a and HY5-RNAi plants. Dual-luciferase assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation–qPCR revealed that HY5 could activate the starch degradation-related genes PWD, BAM1, BAM3, BAM8, MEX1, and DPE1 by directly binding to their promoters. Silencing of HY5 and these starch degradation-related genes in CRY1a-overexpressing plants led to increased accumulation of starch and decreased accumulation of soluble sugars. The findings presented here not only deepen our understanding of how light controls starch degradation and sugar accumulation but also allow us to explore potential targets for improving crop quality.},

In photosynthetic organs, BMY activity is present in the chloroplast, where substrate starch is localized. BMY activity is also found in the vacuole and cytosol, where starch is not known to be localized suggesting additional roles in glucan degradation. Transcript levels and activity of different isoforms are regulated by different stimuli including cold, heat and drought stress. However, little is known about the functional role of BMY during environmental stresses. Recently, the functionality of one of the chloroplastic forms of Arabidopsis, ct-Bmy/BMY8/BAM3, has been shown to be needed for the protection of PSII photochemical efficiency following freezing stress by presumably catalyzing the synthesis of maltose, which acts as a cryoprotectant compound and precursor of soluble sugar metabolism. Still, there remain important questions about how the mobilization of starch through maltose and glucose can lead to the accumulation of cryoprotectant soluble carbohydrates during cold acclimation.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2229-13-229},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: How plants respond to dehydration stress has been extensively researched. However, how plants respond to multiple consecutive stresses is virtually unknown. Pre-exposure to various abiotic stresses (including dehydration) may alter plants' subsequent responses by improving resistance to future exposures. These observations have led to the concept of 'stress memory' implying that during subsequent exposures plants provide responses that are different from those during their first encounter with the stress. Genes that provide altered responses in a subsequent stress define the 'memory genes' category; genes responding similarly to each stress form the 'non-memory' category.
RESULTS: Using a genome-wide RNA-Seq approach we determine the transcriptional responses of Arabidopsis plants that have experienced multiple exposures to dehydration stress and compare them with the transcriptional behavior of plants encountering the stress for the first time. The major contribution of this study is the revealed existence of four distinct, previously unknown, transcription memory response patterns of dehydration stress genes in A.thaliana. The biological relevance for each of the four memory types is considered in the context of four overlapping strategies employed by a plant to improve its stress tolerance and/or survival: 1) increased synthesis of protective, damage-repairing, and detoxifying functions; 2) coordinating photosynthesis and growth under repetitive stress; 3) re-adjusting osmotic and ionic equilibrium to maintain homeostasis; and 4) re-adjusting interactions between dehydration and other stress/hormone regulated pathways.
CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal the unknown, hitherto, existence of four distinct transcription memory response types in a plant and provide genome-wide characterization of memory and non-memory dehydration stress response genes in A.thaliana. The transcriptional responses during repeated exposures to stress are different from known responses occurring during a single exposure. GO analyses of encoded proteins suggested implications for the cellular/organismal protective, adaptive, and survival functions encoded by the memory genes. The results add a new dimension to our understanding of plants' responses to dehydration stress and to current models for interactions between different signaling systems when adjusting to repeated spells of water deficits.},

By structural characteristics and phylogenetic comparison, the 21 representatives are assigned to 3 classes and 14 groups. Particularly striking is the finding of a new class of Hsfs (AtHsfC1) closely related to Hsf1 from rice and to Hsfs identified from frequently found expressed sequence tags of tomato, potato, barley, and soybean. Evidently, this new type of Hsf is well expressed in different plant tissues. Besides the DNA binding and oligomerization domains (HR-A/B region), we identified other functional modules of Arabidopsis Hsfs by sequence comparison with the well-characterized tomato Hsfs. These are putative motifs for nuclear import and export and transcriptional activation (AHA motifs). There is intriguing flexibility of size and sequence in certain parts of the otherwise strongly conserved N-terminal half of these Hsfs. We have speculated about possible exon-intron borders in this region in the ancient precursor gene of plant Hsfs, similar to the exon-intron structure of the present mammalian Hsf-encoding genes.},

	abstract = {Background
Light and temperature are the key abiotic modulators of plant gene expression. In the present work the effect of light under low temperature treatment was analyzed by using microarrays. Specific attention was paid to the up and down regulated genes by using promoter analysis. This approach revealed putative regulatory networks of transcription factors behind the induction or repression of the genes.

Results
Induction of a few oxidative stress related genes occurred only under the Cold/Light treatment including genes encoding iron superoxide dismutase (FeSOD) and glutathione-dependent hydrogen peroxide peroxidases (GPX). The ascorbate dependent water-water cycle genes showed no response to Cold/Light or Cold/Dark treatments. Cold/Light specifically induced genes encoding protective molecules like phenylpropanoids and photosynthesis-related carotenoids also involved in the biosynthesis of hormone abscisic acid (ABA) crucial for cold acclimation. The enhanced/repressed transcript levels were not always reflected on the respective protein levels as demonstrated by dehydrin proteins.

Conclusion
Cold/Light up regulated twice as many genes as the Cold/Dark treatment and only the combination of light and low temperature enhanced the expression of several genes earlier described as cold-responsive genes. Cold/Light-induced genes included both cold-responsive transcription factors and several novel ones containing zinc-finger, MYB, NAC and AP2 domains. These are likely to function in concert in enhancing gene expression. Similar response elements were found in the promoter regions of both the transcription factors and their target genes implying a possible parallel regulation or amplification of the environmental signals according to the metabolic/redox state in the cells.},

	abstract = {Acquired thermotolerance in plants refers to the ability to cope with lethal high temperatures following acclimatization at sublethal high temperatures. Acquired thermotolerance reflects an actual thermotolerance mechanism naturally occurring in plants and has been extensively used in thermotolerant line identification. In recent years, great progress has been achieved in the elucidation of biochemical, physiological, and molecular mechanisms of thermotolerance acquisition by using genomic approaches, including microarray analysis and mutation, knockout, and overexpression of related genes. Heat shock proteins (HSPs), such as Hsp101, BOBBER1, and Hsa32, have been shown to be important for inducement and maintenance of acquired thermotolerance. Downstream target genes and upstream regulation factors of HsfA2, including Hsa32, Apx2, small ubiquitin-like modifier proteins, FK506-binding proteins ROF1 (FKBP62) and ROF2 (FKBP65), and heat shock transcription factor binding protein, have been revealed to be involved in thermotolerance acquisition regulation. Moreover, the role of abscisic acid, ethylene, hydrogen peroxide, and salicylic acid in acquired thermotolerance has been demonstrated by molecular evidence from Arabidopsis mutants and transgenic lines. Most importantly, different molecular mechanisms of thermotolerance acquisition have been shown to underlie various acclimatization methods. Establishment of an experimental system similar to natural conditions is important for further exploration of natural thermotolerance mechanisms.},

Both genes are induced in plants exposed to 37 °C, but only ROF2 is a bonafide heat-stress protein, undetected when plants are grown at 22 °C. ROF1/ROF2 proteins accumulate at 37 °C, remain stable for at least 4 h upon recovery at 22 °C, whereas, their mRNA level is reduced after 1 h at 22 °C. By protein interaction assays, it was demonstrated, that ROF1 is a novel partner of HSP90. The five amino acids identified as essential for recognition and interaction between the mammalian chaperones and HSP90 are conserved in the plant ROF1-HSP90. We suggest that ROF/HSP90 complexes assemble in vivo. We propose that specific complexes formation between an HSP90 and ROF isoforms depends on their spatial and temporal expression.

	abstract = {The ROF2 (FKBP65) is a heat stress protein which belongs to the FK506 Binding Protein (FKBP) family. It is homologous to ROF1 (FKBP62) which was recently shown to be involved in long term acquired thermotolerance by its interaction with HSP90.1 and modulation of the heat shock transcription factor HsfA2. In this study, we have demonstrated that ROF2 participates in long term acquired thermolerance, its mode of action being different from ROF1. In the absence of ROF2, the small heat shock proteins were highly expressed and the plants were resistant to heat stress, opposite to the effect observed in the absence of ROF1. It was further demonstrated that ROF2 transcription is modulated by HsfA2 which is also essential for keeping high levels of ROF2 during recovery from heat stress. ROF2 localization to the nucleus was observed several hours after heat stress exposure and its translocation to the nucleus was independent from the presence of HSP90.1 or HsfA2. ROF2 has been shown to interact with ROF1, to form heterodimers and it is suggested that via this interaction it can join the complex ROF1-HSP90.1- HsfA2. Transient expression of ROF2 together with ROF1 repressed transcription of small HSPs. A model describing the mode of action of ROF2 as a heat stress modulator which functions in negative feedback regulation of HsfA2 is proposed.},

The response of Arabidopsis plants to a combination of drought and heat stress was found to be distinct from that of plants subjected to drought or heat stress. Transcriptome analysis of Arabidopsis plants subjected to a combination of drought and heat stress revealed a new pattern of defense response in plants that includes a partial combination of two multigene defense pathways (i.e. drought and heat stress), as well as 454 transcripts that are specifically expressed in plants during a combination of drought and heat stress. Metabolic profiling of plants subjected to drought, heat stress, or a combination of drought and heat stress revealed that plants subject to a combination of drought and heat stress accumulated sucrose and other sugars such as maltose and gulose. In contrast, Pro that accumulated in plants subjected to drought did not accumulate in plants during a combination of drought and heat stress. Heat stress was found to ameliorate the toxicity of Pro to cells, suggesting that during a combination of drought and heat stress sucrose replaces Pro in plants as the major osmoprotectant.

While budding yeast contains a single NAP1 gene, multicellular organisms, including plants and animals, contain several NAP1 and NAP1-RELATED PROTEIN (NRP) genes. However, the biological role of these genes has been largely unexamined. Here, we show that, in Arabidopsis thaliana, simultaneous knockout of the two NRP genes, NRP1 and NRP2, impaired postembryonic root growth. In the nrp1-1 nrp2-1 double mutant, arrest of cell cycle progression at G2/M and disordered cellular organization occurred in root tips. The mutant seedlings exhibit perturbed expression of ∼100 genes, including some genes involved in root proliferation and patterning. The mutant plants are highly sensitive to genotoxic stress and show increased levels of DNA damage and the release of transcriptional gene silencing. NRP1 and NRP2 are localized in the nucleus and can form homomeric and heteromeric protein complexes. Both proteins specifically bind histones H2A and H2B and associate with chromatin in vivo. We propose that NRP1 and NRP2 act as H2A/H2B chaperones in the maintenance of dynamic chromatin in epigenetic inheritance.},

In the present work we demonstrate that its plant orthologs, designated as NAP-related proteins (NRPs), have a similar in vitro biochemical activity and interact with PP2A and histone H3(pSer10) in vivo. Although heat shock gene promoters were found to be associated with histone H3(pSer10)–marked chromatin following a high temperature treatment, heat shock gene expression was not affected in NRP-deficient mutant Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) plantlets. These observations indicate that NRPs are potential regulators of histone dephosphorylation in plants, but they are dispensable for gene expression reorganization in response to heat shock.},

	abstract = {Nucleosome Assembly Protein (NAP) is a highly conserved family of histone chaperones present in yeast, animals, and plants. Unlike other organisms, plants possess an additional class of proteins in its NAP family, known as the NAP1-related proteins or NRP. Arabidopsis thaliana possesses two NRP isoforms, namely AtNRP1 and AtNRP2, that share 87\% sequence identity. Both AtNRP1 and AtNRP2 get expressed in all the plant tissues. Most works in the past, including structural studies, have focused on AtNRP1. We wanted to do a comparative study of the two proteins to find why the plant would have two very similar proteins and whether there is any difference between the two for their structure and function as histone chaperones. Here we report the crystal structure of AtNRP2 and a comparative analysis of its structural architecture with other NAP family proteins. The crystal structure of AtNRP2 shows it to be a homodimer, with its fold similar to that of other structurally characterized NAP family proteins. Although AtNRP1 and AtNRP2 have a similar fold, upon structural superposition, we find an offset in the dimerization helix of the two proteins. We evaluated the stability, oligomerization status, and histone chaperoning properties of the two proteins, for a comparison. The thermal melting experiments suggest that AtNRP2 is more stable than AtNRP1 at higher temperatures. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments suggest histone binding ability of AtNRP2 is higher than that of AtNRP1. Overall, these results provide insights about the specific function and relevance of AtNRP2 in plants through structural and biophysical studies.},

Although it is believed that these proteins are nuclear and bind the chromatin, they can be detected in the cytoplasmic but not in the nuclear protein fraction by immunoblotting analysis. It is shown here that under normal conditions, NRPs are nuclear but soluble and leak out of the nuclei during their purification. However, under elevated temperatures (above 42 °C), NRPs display significantly reduced mobility and are retained in the nuclei during purification probably due to binding other immobile macromolecules in the nucleus. Our observations highlight the necessity to use different techniques in parallel to unambiguously determine the intracellular localization of proteins. As heat adapted (38 °C, 2 h followed by 2 h recovery) and heat shocked (45 °C, 1 h), Arabidopsis seedlings were found to have phenotypes similar to those observed in the NRP loss-of-function mutants nrp1-1 nrp2-1 (short, branching roots, increased bleomycin sensitivity), it was also investigated whether the immobilization of NRPs by heat results in disturbed NRP functions. The results indicated, however, that heat affected the investigated traits independent on the presence of NRPs.},

A number of envelope membrane proteins have been identified by biochemical approaches and have been assigned to specific functions. Despite those efforts, the chloroplast envelope membrane is expected to contain a number of as yet unidentified proteins that may affect specific aspects of plant growth and development. In this report, we identify and characterize a novel class of inner envelope membrane proteins, designated as Cor413 chloroplast inner envelope membrane group (Cor413im). Both in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that Cor413im proteins are targeted to the chloroplast envelope. Biochemical analyses of Cor413im1 demonstrate that it is an integral membrane protein in the inner envelope of chloroplasts. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis reveals that COR413IM1 is more abundant than COR413IM2 in cold-acclimated Arabidopsis leaves. The analyses of T-DNA insertion mutants indicate that a single copy of COR413IM genes is sufficient to provide normal freezing tolerance to Arabidopsis. Based on these data, we propose that Cor413im proteins are novel components that are targeted to the chloroplast inner envelope in response to low temperature.},

Using the yeast one-hybrid system, we isolated three cDNA clones encoding proteins that bind to the 63-bp promoter region of erd1, which contains the CATGTG motif. These three cDNA clones encode proteins named ANAC019, ANAC055, and ANAC072, which belong to the NAC transcription factor family. The NAC proteins bound specifically to the CATGTG motif both in vitro and in vivo and activated the transcription of a β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene driven by the 63-bp region containing the CATGTG motif in Arabidopsis T87 protoplasts. The expression of ANAC019, ANAC055, and ANAC072 was induced by drought, high salinity, and abscisic acid. A histochemical assay using PNAC-GUS fusion constructs showed that expression of the GUS reporter gene was localized mainly to the leaves of transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Using the yeast one-hybrid system, we determined the complete NAC recognition sequence, containing CATGT and harboring CACG as the core DNA binding site. Microarray analysis of transgenic plants overexpressing either ANAC019, ANAC055, or ANAC072 revealed that several stress-inducible genes were upregulated in the transgenic plants, and the plants showed significantly increased drought tolerance. However, erd1 was not upregulated in the transgenic plants. Other interacting factors may be necessary for the induction of erd1 in Arabidopsis under stress conditions.},

ACA8 is a Ca2+ pump (Ca2+-ATPase), which presumably exports Ca2+from the cytosol to the apoplast.


ACA8 is localized to the plasma membrane.


Novel discoveries


ACA8pro::GUS and RT-qPCR of different plant tissues. 


ACA8 is expressed in many tissues but predominantly in leaves (guard cells, vascular bundles) and roots (stele).




Transfer from 22C to 5C.


ACA8 expression declines 2h after transfer cold, then peaks at 8h, starts to decline and returns to basal levels after 48h.




ACA8 promoter has a CCGAC sequence corresponding to a C-repeat/dehydration-responsive element motif (CRT/DRE).


Questions


Is ACA8 downstream of CBFs?


It seems so, in Park et al., 2018 they put it as part of the CBF regulon

	abstract = {Transient changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration have been well recognized to act as cell signals coupling various environmental stimuli to appropriate physiological responses with accuracy and specificity in plants. Calmodulin (CaM) and calmodulin-like proteins (CMLs) are major Ca2+ sensors, playing critical roles in interpreting encrypted Ca2+ signals. Ca2+-loaded CaM/CMLs interact and regulate a broad spectrum of target proteins such as channels/pumps/antiporters for various ions, transcription factors, protein kinases, protein phosphatases, metabolic enzymes, and proteins with unknown biochemical functions. Many of the target proteins of CaM/CMLs directly or indirectly regulate plant responses to environmental stresses. Basic information about stimulus-induced Ca2+ signal and overview of Ca2+ signal perception and transduction are briefly discussed in the beginning of this review. How CaM/CMLs are involved in regulating plant responses to abiotic stresses are emphasized in this review. Exciting progress has been made in the past several years, such as the elucidation of Ca2+/CaM-mediated regulation of AtSR1/CAMTA3 and plant responses to chilling and freezing stresses, Ca2+/CaM-mediated regulation of CAT3, MAPK8 and MKP1 in homeostasis control of reactive oxygen species signals, discovery of CaM7 as a DNA-binding transcription factor regulating plant response to light signals. However, many key questions in Ca2+/CaM-mediated signaling warrant further investigation. Ca2+/CaM-mediated regulation of most of the known target proteins is presumed based on their interaction. The downstream targets of CMLs are mostly unknown, and how specificity of Ca2+ signaling could be realized through the actions of CaM/CMLs and their target proteins is largely unknown. Future breakthroughs in Ca2+/CaM-mediated signaling will not only improve our understanding of how plants respond to environmental stresses, but also provide the knowledge base to improve stress-tolerance of crops.},

Overexpression of KCS1 in the akr2a mutants could enhance VLCFAs contents and chilling tolerance. Yeast-2-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BIFC) results showed that the transmembrane motif of KCS1 interacts with the PEST motif of AKR2A both in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of KCS1 in akr2a mutants rescued akr2a mutant phenotypes, including chilling sensitivity and a decrease of VLCFAs contents. Moreover, the transgenic plants co-overexpressing AKR2A and KCS1 exhibited a greater chilling tolerance than the plants overexpressing AKR2A or KCS1 alone, as well as the wild-type. AKR2A knockdown and kcs1 knockout mutants showed the worst performance under chilling conditions.

Here, we report the identification of semidominant alleles for a class III homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factor, HOMEOBOX DOMAIN-2 (HB-2), on wheat A and D subgenomes, which generate more flower-bearing spikelets and enhance grain protein content. These alleles increase HB-2 expression by disrupting a microRNA 165/166 complementary site with conserved roles in plants; higher HB-2 expression is associated with modified leaf and vascular development and increased amino acid supply to the inflorescence during grain development.

Subsets of 460 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in drought-tolerant genotype and 236 in drought-sensitive genotype were distinguished and functionally annotated with 105 gene ontology (GO) terms and 77 metabolic pathways. Transcriptome profiling of drought-resistant genotype “L-82” showed up-regulation of genes mostly involved in Oxidation-reduction process, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, abiotic stress response, transferase activity and heat shock proteins. On the other hand, down-regulated genes mostly involved in signaling, oxidation-reduction process, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, auxin-responsive protein and lipid metabolism. We hypothesized that the drought tolerance in “L-82” was a result of avoidance strategies. Up-regulation of genes related to the deeper root system and adequate hydraulic characteristics to allow water uptake under water scarcity confirms our hypothesis. The transcriptomic sequences generated in this study provide information about mechanisms of acclimation to drought in the selected bread wheat landrace, “L-82”, and will help us to unravel the mechanisms underlying the ability of crops to reproduce and keep its productivity even under drought stress.},

	abstract = {Cereal cyst nematode (CCN, Heterodera avenae) presents severe challenges to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production worldwide. An investigation of the interaction between wheat and CCN can greatly improve our understanding of how nematodes alter wheat root metabolic pathways for their development and could contribute to new control strategies against CCN. In this study, we conducted transcriptome analyses of wheat cv. Wen 19 (Wen19) by using RNA-Seq during the compatible interaction with CCN at 1, 3 and 8 days past inoculation (dpi). In total, 71,569 transcripts were identified, and 10,929 of them were examined as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to CCN infection. Based on the functional annotation and orthologous findings, the protein phosphorylation, oxidation-reduction process, regulation of transcription, metabolic process, transport, and response process as well as many other pathways previously reported were enriched at the transcriptional level. Plant cell wall hydrolysis and modifying proteins, auxin biosynthesis, signalling and transporter genes were up-regulated by CCN infection to facilitate penetration, migration and syncytium establishment. Genes responding to wounding and jasmonic acid stimuli were enriched at 1 dpi. We found 16 NBS-LRR genes, 12 of which were down-regulated, indicating the repression of resistance. The expression of genes encoding antioxidant enzymes, glutathione S-transferases and UDP-glucosyltransferase was significantly up-regulated during CCN infection, indicating that they may play key roles in the compatible interaction of wheat with CCN. Taken together, the results obtained from the transcriptome analyses indicate that the genes involved in oxidation-reduction processes, induction and suppression of resistance, metabolism, transport and syncytium establishment may be involved in the compatible interaction of Wen 19 with CCN. This study provides new insights into the responses of wheat to CCN infection. These insights could facilitate the elucidation of the potential mechanisms of wheat responses to CCN.},

In Arabidopsis thaliana, photosynthetic acclimation to cold requires the accumulation of the organic acid fumarate, catalysed by a cytosolically localized fumarase, FUM2.

Here, we use an integrated experimental and modelling approach to examine the role of FUM2 and fumarate across the physiological temperature range. We have studied three genotypes: Col-0; a fum2 mutant in a Col-0 background; and C24, an accession with reduced FUM2 expression. While low temperature causes an increase in Pmax in the Col-0 plants, this parameter decreases following exposure of plants to 30 °C for 7 d. Plants in which fumarate accumulation is partially (C24) or completely (fum2) abolished show a reduced acclimation of Pmax across the physiological temperature range (i.e. Pmax changes less in response to changing temperature). To understand the role of fumarate accumulation, we have adapted a reliability engineering technique, Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), to formalize a rigorous approach for ranking metabolites according to the potential risk that they pose to the metabolic system. FMEA identifies fumarate as a low-risk metabolite, while its precursor, malate, is shown to be high risk and liable to cause system instability. We propose that the role of FUM2 is to provide a fail-safe in order to control malate concentration, maintaining system stability in a changing environment. We suggest that FMEA is a technique that is not only useful in understanding plant metabolism but can also be used to study reliability in other systems and synthetic pathways.},

	abstract = {Exposure to cold triggers a spike in cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) that often leads to transcriptional reprogramming in plants. However, how this Ca2+ signal is perceived and relayed to the downstream cold signaling pathway remains unknown. Here, we show that the CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE 28 (CPK28) initiates a phosphorylation cascade to specify transcriptional reprogramming downstream of cold-induced Ca2+ signal. Plasma membrane (PM)–localized CPK28 is activated rapidly upon cold shock within 10 seconds in a Ca2+-dependent manner. CPK28 then phosphorylates and promotes the nuclear translocation of NIN-LIKE PROTEIN 7 (NLP7), a transcription factor that specifies the transcriptional reprogramming of cold-responsive gene sets in response to Ca2+, thereby positively regulating plant response to cold stress. This study elucidates a previously unidentified mechanism by which the CPK28-NLP7 regulatory module integrates cold-evoked Ca2+ signal and transcriptome and thus uncovers a key strategy for the rapid perception and transduction of cold signals from the PM to the nucleus.},

	abstract = {Cold shock elicits an immediate rise in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) in both chilling-resistant Arabidopsis and chilling-sensitive tobacco (Nicotiana plumbaginifolia). In Arabidopsis, lanthanum or EGTA caused a partial inhibition of both cold shock [Ca2+]cyt elevation and cold-dependent kin1 gene expression. This suggested that calcium influx plays a major role in the cold shock [Ca2+]cyt response and that an intracellular calcium source also might be involved. To investigate whether the vacuole (the major intracellular calcium store in plants) is involved, we targeted the calcium-dependent photoprotein aequorin to the cytosolic face of the vacuolar membrane. Cold shock calcium kinetics in this microdomain were consistent with a cold-induced vacuolar release of calcium. Treatment with neomycin or lithium, which interferes with phosphoinositide cycling, resulted in cold shock [Ca2+]cyt kinetics consistent with the involvement of inositol trisphosphate and inositide phosphate signaling in this response. We also investigated the effects of repeated and prolonged low temperature on cold shock [Ca2+]cyt. Differences were observed between the responses of Arabidopsis and N. plum-baginifolia to repeated cold stimulation. Acclimation of Arabidopsis by pretreatment with cold or hydrogen peroxide caused a modified calcium signature to subsequent cold shock. This suggests that acclimation involves modification of plant calcium signaling to provide a "cold memory."},

	abstract = {Temperature is a key factor governing the growth and development, distribution, and seasonal behavior of plants. The entire plant life cycle is affected by environmental temperatures. Plants grow rapidly and exhibit speciﬁc changes in morphology under mild average temperature conditions, a response termed thermomorphogenesis. When exposed to chilling or moist chilling low temperatures, ﬂowering or seed germination is accelerated in some plant species; these processes are known as vernalization and cold stratiﬁcation, respectively. Interestingly, once many temperate plants are exposed to chilling temperatures for some time, they can acquire the ability to resist freezing stress, a process termed cold acclimation. In the face of global climate change, heat stress has emerged as a frequent challenge, which adversely affects plant growth and development. In this review, we summarize and discuss recent progress in dissecting the molecular mechanisms regulating plant thermomorphogenesis, vernalization, and responses to extreme temperatures. We also discuss the remaining issues that are crucial for understanding the interactions between plants and temperature.},

To understand signal transduction pathways from the cold stress signal to gene expression, we characterized a gene family for DRE/CRT-binding proteins DREB1A and CBF1 in Arabidopsis thaliana. DREB1A and CBF1 were shown to be involved in low-temperature-responsive gene expression. We screened an Arabidopsis genomic DNA library with the cDNA fragment of DREB1A as a probe and isolated DREB1A and 2 related genes, DREB1B (= CBF1) and DREB1C. These were arrayed in the order B, A, C in an 8.7 kb region of Arabidopsis chromosome 4. Northern blot analysis using gene-specific probes showed that the 3 DREB1 genes are induced mainly by cold stress but not by osmotic stress in leaves, roots, and stems. Several conserved sequences were found in the promoter regions of all 3 genes. The beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene driven by the DREB1 promoters was induced at transcriptional level by low temperature in transgenic Arabidopsis plants.},

	abstract = {Plants respond to herbivory through various morphological, biochemicals, and molecular mechanisms to counter/offset the effects of herbivore attack. The biochemical mechanisms of defense against the herbivores are wide-ranging, highly dynamic, and are mediated both by direct and indirect defenses. The defensive compounds are either produced constitutively or in response to plant damage, and affect feeding, growth, and survival of herbivores. In addition, plants also release volatile organic compounds that attract the natural enemies of the herbivores. These strategies either act independently or in conjunction with each other. However, our understanding of these defensive mechanisms is still limited. Induced resistance could be exploited as an important tool for the pest management to minimize the amounts of insecticides used for pest control. Host plant resistance to insects, particularly, induced resistance, can also be manipulated with the use of chemical elicitors of secondary metabolites, which confer resistance to insects. By understanding the mechanisms of induced resistance, we can predict the herbivores that are likely to be affected by induced responses. The elicitors of induced responses can be sprayed on crop plants to build up the natural defense system against damage caused by herbivores. The induced responses can also be engineered genetically, so that the defensive compounds are constitutively produced in plants against are challenged by the herbivory. Induced resistance can be exploited for developing crop cultivars, which readily produce the inducible response upon mild infestation, and can act as one of components of integrated pest management for sustainable crop production.},

	abstract = {The Arabidopsis CBF1, 2, and 3 genes (also known as DREB1b, c, and a, respectively) encode transcriptional activators that have a central role in cold tolerance. CBF1-3 are rapidly induced upon exposing plants to low temperature, followed by expression of CBF-targeted genes, the CBF regulon, resulting in an increase in plant freezing tolerance. At present, little is known about the cold-sensing mechanism that controls CBF expression. Results presented here indicate that this mechanism does not require a cold shock to bring about the accumulation of CBF transcripts, but instead, absolute temperature is monitored with a greater degree of input, i.e. lower temperature, resulting in a greater output, i.e. higher levels of CBF transcripts. Temperature-shift experiments also indicate that the cold-sensing mechanism becomes desensitized to a given low temperature, such as 4 degrees C, and that resensitization to that temperature requires between 8 and 24 h at warm temperature. Gene fusion experiments identified a 125-bp section of the CBF2 promoter that is sufficient to impart cold-responsive gene expression. Mutational analysis of this cold-responsive region identified two promoter segments that work in concert to impart robust cold-regulated gene expression. These sequences, designated ICEr1 and ICEr2 (induction of CBF expression region 1 or 2), were also shown to stimulate transcription in response to mechanical agitation and the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide.},

Plants have to interpret temperature fluctuations, over hourly to monthly timescales, to align their growth and development with the seasons. Much is known about how plants respond to acute thermal stresses3,4, but the mechanisms that integrate long-term temperature exposure remain unknown. The slow, winter-long upregulation of VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3)5–7, a PHD protein that functions with Polycomb repressive complex 2 to epigenetically silence FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) during vernalization, is central to plants interpreting winter progression5,6,8–11. Here, by a forward genetic screen, we identify two dominant mutations of the transcription factor NTL8 that constitutively activate VIN3 expression and alter the slow VIN3 cold induction profile. In the wild type, the NTL8 protein accumulates slowly in the cold, and directly upregulates VIN3 transcription. Through combining computational simulation and experimental validation, we show that a major contributor to this slow accumulation is reduced NTL8 dilution due to slow growth at low temperatures. Temperature-dependent growth is thus exploited through protein dilution to provide the long-term thermosensory information for VIN3 upregulation. Indirect mechanisms involving temperature-dependent growth, in addition to direct thermosensing, may be widely relevant in long-term biological sensing of naturally fluctuating temperatures.},

Low temperatures facilitate FT sequestration in the cellular membrane of the companion cell, thus reducing soluble FT levels and delaying flowering. A mutant in PHOSPHATIDYLGLYCEROLPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE 1 accumulates more soluble FT at lower temperatures and exhibits reduced temperature sensitivity.

In the more natural environment of temperature cycles, plants actively manage PM viscosity to counteract the direct effects of temperature. • Plasma membrane viscosity is regulated by altering the proportion of desaturated fatty acids. In cold conditions, cell membranes accumulate desaturated fatty acids, which decreases membrane viscosity and vice versa. Moreover, we show that control of fatty acid desaturase 2 (FAD2)-dependent lipid desaturation is essential for this homeostasis of membrane viscosity.

Here, we investigate the temperature signals in field conditions that result in vernalisation, the mechanism by which flowering is aligned with spring. We find that multiple, distinct aspects of the temperature profile contribute to vernalisation. In autumn, transient cold temperatures promote transcriptional shutdown of

              (
              FLC
              ), independently of factors conferring epigenetic memory. As winter continues, expression of VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE3 (VIN3), a factor needed for epigenetic silencing, is upregulated by at least two independent thermosensory processes. One integrates long-term cold temperatures, while the other requires the absence of daily temperatures above 15 °C. The lack of spikes of high temperature, not just prolonged cold, is thus the major driver for vernalisation. Monitoring of peak daily temperature is an effective mechanism to judge seasonal progression, but is likely to have deleterious consequences for vernalisation as the climate becomes more variable.},

            Analysis of how seasonal cues influence the timing of the floral transition has revealed many important principles for how epigenetic regulation can integrate a variety of environmental cues with developmental signals. The study of the pathways that necessitate overwintering in plants and their ability to respond to prolonged cold (the vernalization requirement and response pathways) has elaborated different chromatin regulatory pathways and the involvement of noncoding RNAs. The major target of these vernalization pathways in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) is Flowering Locus C (FLC). A relatively simple picture of FLC regulation is emerging of a few core complexes and mechanisms that antagonize each other’s actions. This balance provides a fine degree of control that has nevertheless permitted evolution of a wide range of natural variation in vernalization in Arabidopsis. Similar simple routes of adaptation may underlie life history variation between species.},

In this study, we demonstrate that the CRYPTOCHROME2 (CRY2)-COP1-HY5-BBX7/8 module regulates blue light-dependent cold acclimation in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that phosphorylated forms of CRY2 induced by blue light are stabilized by cold stress and that cold-stabilized CRY2 competes with the transcription factor HY5 to attenuate the HY5-COP1 interaction, thereby allowing HY5 to accumulate at cold temperatures. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that B-BOX DOMAIN PROTEIN7 (BBX7) and BBX8 function as direct HY5 targets that positively regulate freezing tolerance by modulating the expression of a set of cold-responsive genes, which mainly occurs independently of the C-repeat-binding factor pathway. Our study uncovers a mechanistic framework by which CRY2-mediated blue-light signaling enhances freezing tolerance, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between cold and light signaling pathways in plants.},

Here, we report the genome sequencing of 39 accessions that were used to establish a white lupin pangenome. We defined 32 068 core genes that are present in all individuals and 14 822 that are absent in some and may represent a gene pool for breeding for improved productivity, grain quality, and stress adaptation. We used this new pangenome resource to identify candidate genes for alkaloid synthesis, a key grain quality trait. The white lupin pangenome provides a novel genetic resource to better understand how domestication has shaped the genomic variability within this crop. Thus, this pangenome resource is an important step towards the effective and efficient genetic improvement of white lupin to help meet the rapidly growing demand for plant protein sources for human and animal consumption.},

Nevertheless, lupin cultivation in Europe remains largely insufficient to guarantee a steady supply to the food industry, which in turn must innovate to produce attractive lupin-based protein-rich foods. Here, we address different aspects of the food supply chain that should be considered for lupin exploitation as a high-value protein source. Advanced breeding techniques are needed to provide new lupin varieties for socio-economically and environmentally sustainable cultivation. Novel processes should be optimized to obtain high-quality, safe lupin protein ingredients, and marketable foods need to be developed and offered to consumers. With such an integrated strategy, lupins can be established as an alternative protein crop, capable of promoting socio-economic growth and environmental benefits in Europe.},

Elevated and high-quality protein content.


Seed protein content is up to 44\%.


Good quality of proteins.




Alternative to soya bean (so that Europe stops relying on soya bean import).


Lupin production in Europe is currently insufficient to guarantee the stable and sufficient supply required for its use by the food industry.


Limited breeding, which is a barrier to expansion and economic sustainability. 




Great grain yield (the world’s highest) in some parts of Europe...


Relatively more tolerant to several abiotic stresses compared to other legumes.


Implications for the world


Ever-growing world population, demand for dietary protein (it is no longer sustainable to rely on animal products alone).


Soya bean is the prevalent source of plant protein.


Investigate further/Ideas


Lupin landraces? (Annicchiarico 2010)


Identifying germplasm with tolerance to abiotic stresses may allow lupin cultivation to expand into a wider range of agro-climatic conditions…


In areas subjected to frequent/occasional frosts, high vernalization requirement along with intrinsic cold tolerance is required, as sudden winter frosts may lead to high mortaility…


How does the temperature/day length affect the seed characteristics (particularly in lupin there seems to be quite a lot of interest in seed traits for nutrition), e.g., Penfield stuff…

The Ku mutation is now widely used in lupin breeding to confer early flowering and maturity. We report here the identity of the Ku mutation. We used a range of genetic, genomic and gene expression approaches to determine whether Flowering Locus T (FT) homologues are associated with the Ku locus. One of four FT homologues present in the narrow-leafed lupin genome, LanFTc1, perfectly co-segregated with the Ku locus in a reference mapping population. Expression of LanFTc1 in the ku (late-flowering) parent was strongly induced by vernalization, in contrast to the Ku (early-flowering) parent, which showed constitutively high LanFTc1 expression. Co-segregation of this expression phenotype with the LanFTc1 genotype indicated that the Ku mutation impairs cis-regulation of LanFTc1. Sequencing of LanFTc1 revealed a 1.4-kb deletion in the promoter region, which was perfectly predictive of vernalization response in 216 wild and domesticated accessions. Linkage disequilibrium rapidly decayed around LanFTc1, suggesting that this deletion caused the loss of vernalization response. This is the first time a legume FTc subclade gene has been implicated in the vernalization response.},

Moreover, white lupin is very susceptible to anthracnose, and the only known resistant lines are late-flowering landraces from Ethiopia. Tracking of early flowering during white lupin breeding has been challenging for many years due to the lack of knowledge on underlying genes and limited molecular resources. To address this issue, we performed genomic and genetic analysis of white lupin germplasm differing by time to flowering, including mapping population derived from Kiev Mutant (early flowering, anthracnose susceptible) and P27174 (late flowering, anthracnose resistant). Thirty six flowering induction pathway genes were subjected to molecular marker development and linkage mapping. Markers representing 24 homologs were localized in 17 linkage groups. Four quantitative trait loci (QTLs) of flowering time, consistent across field and greenhouse experiments, were localized in three linkage groups. Three QTLs absolutely co-localized with GIGANTEA, FLOWERING LOCUS T, and SEPALLATA 3 gene–based markers whereas one neighbored the FRIGIDA 3 marker by 3.6 cM. Analysis of narrow-leafed lupin genome regions highly syntenic to these QTLs highlighted these homologs as candidate genes for early flowering.

It is cultivated under photoperiods ranging from 9 to 17 h, as a spring-sown (in colder locations) or as an autumn-sown crop (in warmer regions). Wild populations require a prolonged cold period, called vernalization, to induce flowering. The key achievement of L. angustifolius domestication was the discovery of two natural mutations (named Ku and Jul) conferring vernalization independence. These mutations are overlapping deletion variants in the promoter of LanFTc1, a homolog of the Arabidopsis thaliana FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene. The third deletion, named here as Pal, was recently found in primitive germplasm. In this study, we genotyped L. angustifolius germplasm that differs in domestication status and geographical origin for LanFTc1 alleles, which we then phenotyped to establish flowering time and vernalization responsiveness. The Ku and Jul lines were vernalization-independent and early flowering, wild (ku) lines were vernalization-dependent and late flowering, whereas the Pal line conferred intermediate phenotype. Three lines representing ku, Pal, and Ku alleles were subjected to gene expression surveys under 8- and 16-h photoperiods. FT homologs (LanFTa1, LanFTa2, LanFTc1, and LanFTc2) and some genes selected by recent expression quantitative trait loci mapping were analyzed. Expression profiles of LanFTc1 and LanAGL8 (AGAMOUS-like 8) matched observed differences in flowering time between genotypes, highlighted by high induction after vernalization in the ku line. Moreover, these genes revealed altered circadian clock control in Pal line under short days. LanFD (FD) and LanCRLK1 (CALCIUM/CALMODULIN-REGULATED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 1) were negatively responsive to vernalization in Ku and Pal lines but positively responsive or variable in ku, whereas LanUGT85A2 (UDP-GLUCOSYL TRANSFERASE 85A2) was significantly suppressed by vernalization in all lines. Such a pattern suggests the opposite regulation of these gene pairs in the vernalization pathway. LanCRLK1 and LanUGT85A2 are homologs of A. thaliana genes involved in the FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) vernalization pathway. Lupins, like many other legumes, do not have any FLC homologs. Therefore, candidate genes surveyed in this study, namely LanFTc1, LanAGL8, LanCRLK1, and LanUGT85A2, may constitute anchors for further elucidation of molecular components contributing to vernalization response in legumes.},

To address these changes, cool season legume breeders need to understand molecular control of vernalization and photoperiod. A key floral transition gene integrating signals from these pathways is the Flowering locus T (FT). Here, a recently domesticated grain legume, yellow lupin (Lupinus luteus L.), was explored for potential involvement of FT homologues in abolition of vernalization and photoperiod requirements. Two FTa (LlutFTa1a and LlutFTa1b) and FTc (LlutFTc1 and LlutFTc2) homologues were identified and sequenced for two contrasting parents of a reference recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, an early-flowering cultivar Wodjil and a late-flowering wild-type P28213. Large deletions were detected in the 5′ promoter regions of three FT homologues. Quantitative trait loci were identified for flowering time and vernalization response in the RIL population and in a diverse panel of wild and domesticated accessions. A 2227 bp deletion found in the LlutFTc1 promoter was linked with early phenology and vernalization independence, whereas LlutFTa1a and LlutFTc2 indels with photoperiod responsiveness. Comparative mapping highlighted convergence of FTc1 indel evolution in two Old World lupin species, addressing both artificial selection during domestication and natural adaptation to short season environmental conditions. We concluded that rapid flowering in yellow lupin is associated with the de-repression of the LlutFTc1 homologue from the juvenile phase, putatively due to the elimination of all binding sites in the promoter region for the AGAMOUS-like 15 transcription factor.},

experienced during winters. In Arabidopsis, the vernalization response is, to a large extent, mediated by the repression of the floral repressor FLC, and the stable epigenetic silencing of FLC after cold treatments is essential for vernalization. In addition to FLC, other vernalization targets exist in Arabidopsis. In grasses, vernalization seems to be entirely independent of FLC. Here, the current understanding of FLC-independent branches of the vernalization pathway in Arabidopsis and vernalization without FLC in grasses is discussed. This review focuses on the role of AGL19, AGL24, and the MAF genes in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, vernalization acts through related molecular machineries on distinct targets. In particular, protein complexes

Working with deadly disease-causing microorganisms for their characterization, diagnostics or therapeutics and vaccine development purposes are posing increasingly potential biosafety problems for laboratory workers. Thus, an appropriate biosafe working environment may protect workers from laboratory-induced infections., Biotechnology has the ability to solve the upcoming problems of the world’s increasing population. However, there is often reluctance among the public to accept and support biotechnological products in medicine, industry, or agriculture. There are many safety and ethical issues raised for GM crops and human cloning. Raising transgenic animals and plants has fueled ethical concerns, and the scientists have faced a lot of resistance where genetically modified crop plants or reproductive cloning research of human beings is involved. Thus, biosafety and bioethics are continuously being expanded to combine the rationale of ever-increasing scientific knowledge in biotechnology that is often in conflict with the long-standing social and moral value system of our society.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Commercial semiwinter wheat Zhoumai 18 was exposed to −6°C for 4 h at the four-leave stage. Leaves of the control group and freezing-treated group were used to perform cDNA library construction. PacBio SMRT sequencing yielded 51,570 high-quality isoforms from leaves of control sample of Zhoumai 18, encoded by 20,366 gene loci. In total, 73,695 transcript isoforms, corresponding to 23,039 genes, were identified from the freezing-treated leaves. Compared with transcripts from the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium RefSeq v1.1, 57,667 novel isoforms were discovered, which were annotated 21,672 known gene loci, as well as 3,399 novel gene loci. Transcriptome characterization including alterative spliced events, alternative polydenylation sites, transcription factors, and fusion transcripts were also analyzed. Freezing-responsive genes and signals were uncovered and proved that the ICE-ERF-COR pathway and ABA signal transduction play a vital role in the freezing response of wheat. In this study, PacBio sequencing and Illumina sequencing were applied to investigate the freezing tolerance in common wheat, and the transcriptome results provide insights into the molecular regulation mechanisms under freezing treatment.},

	abstract = {Wheat is a staple food worldwide and provides 40\% of the calories in the diet. Climate change and global warming pose a threat to wheat production, however, and demand a deeper understanding of how heat stress might impact wheat production and wheat biology. However, it is difficult to identify novel heat stress associated genes when the genomic information is not available. Wheat has a very large and complex genome that is about 37 times the size of the rice genome. The present study sequenced the whole transcriptome of the wheat cv. HD2329 at the flowering stage, under control (22° ± 3°C) and heat stress (42°C, 2 h) conditions using Illumina HiSeq and Roche GS-FLX 454 platforms. We assembled more than 26.3 and 25.6 million high-quality reads from the control and HS-treated tissues transcriptome sequences respectively. About 76,556 (control) and 54,033 (HS-treated) contigs were assembled and annotated de novo using different assemblers and a total of 21,529 unigenes were obtained. Gene expression profile showed significant differential expression of 1525 transcripts under heat stress, of which 27 transcripts showed very high ({\textgreater}10) fold upregulation. Cellular processes such as metabolic processes, protein phosphorylation, oxidations-reductions, among others were highly influenced by heat stress. In summary, these observations significantly enrich the transcript dataset of wheat available on public domain and show a de novo approach to discover the heat-responsive transcripts of wheat, which can accelerate the progress of wheat stress-genomics as well as the course of wheat breeding programs in the era of climate change.},

Indeed, over the course of the last 2 years, the genome sequences of several commercially important cereals, notably barley and bread wheat, have become available, as well as those of related wild species. While still incomplete, comparison with other, more completely assembled species suggests that coverage of genic regions is likely to be high. Ensembl Plants (http://plants.ensembl.org) is an integrative resource organizing, analyzing and visualizing genome-scale information for important crop and model plants. Available data include reference genome sequence, variant loci, gene models and functional annotation. For variant loci, individual and population genotypes, linkage information and, where available, phenotypic information are shown. Comparative analyses are performed on DNA and protein sequence alignments. The resulting genome alignments and gene trees, representing the implied evolutionary history of the gene family, are made available for visualization and analysis. Driven by the case of bread wheat, specific extensions to the analysis pipelines and web interface have recently been developed to support polyploid genomes. Data in Ensembl Plants is accessible through a genome browser incorporating various specialist interfaces for different data types, and through a variety of additional methods for programmatic access and data mining. These interfaces are consistent with those offered through the Ensembl interface for the genomes of non-plant species, including those of plant pathogens, pests and pollinators, facilitating the study of the plant in its environment.},

The database was accessible through a web browser with species, search, gene expression, tools, and literature entries. Tools available were BLAST, synteny viewer, map viewer, JBrowse, data downloads, gene expression heatmap and bar chart, and homologs viewer. Moreover, the map viewer connected genomics data with genetic maps and QTL that can be searched for markers for molecular breeding. WheatGene was developed with open-source modules and libraries.

	abstract = {Plants must reprogram gene expression to adapt constantly changing environmental temperatures. With the increased occurrence of extremely low temperatures, the negative effects on plants, especially on growth and development, from cold stress are becoming more and more serious. In this research, strand-specific RNA sequencing (ssRNA-seq) was used to explore the dynamic changes in the transcriptome landscape of Arabidopsis thaliana exposed to cold temperatures (4°C) at different times. In total, 7,623 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) exhibited dynamic temporal changes during the cold treatments. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs were enriched in cold response, secondary metabolic processes, photosynthesis, glucosinolate biosynthesis, and plant hormone signal transduction pathways. Meanwhile, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified after the assembly of the transcripts, from which 247 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs) and their potential target genes were predicted. 3,621 differentially alternatively spliced (DAS) genes related to RNA splicing and spliceosome were identified, indicating enhanced transcriptome complexity due to the alternative splicing (AS) in the cold. In addition, 739 cold-regulated transcription factors (TFs) belonging to 52 gene families were identified as well.

	abstract = {In plants, low temperature causes massive transcriptional changes, many of which are presumed to be involved in the process of cold acclimation. Given the diversity of developmental and environmental factors between experiments, it is surprising that their influence on the identification of cold-responsive genes is largely unknown. A systematic investigation of genes responding to 1 d of cold treatment revealed that diurnal- and circadian-regulated genes are responsible for the majority of the substantial variation between experiments. This is contrary to the widespread assumption that these effects are eliminated using paired diurnal controls. To identify the molecular basis for this variation, we performed targeted expression analyses of diurnal and circadian time courses in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We show that, after a short initial cold response, in diurnal conditions cold reduces the amplitude of cycles for clock components and dampens or disrupts the cycles of output genes, while in continuous light all cycles become arrhythmic. This means that genes identified as cold-responsive are dependent on the time of day the experiment was performed and that a control at normal temperature will not correct for this effect, as was postulated up to now. Time of day also affects the number and strength of expression changes for a large number of transcription factors, and this likely further contributes to experimental differences. This reveals that interactions between cold and diurnal regulation are major factors in shaping the cold-responsive transcriptome and thus will be an important consideration in future experiments to dissect transcriptional regulatory networks controlling cold acclimation. In addition, our data revealed differential effects of cold on circadian output genes and a unique regulation of an oscillator component, suggesting that cold treatment could also be an important tool to probe circadian and diurnal regulatory mechanisms.},

	abstract = {To facilitate the phenotypic characterization of Medicago truncatula, our aim was to provide a framework of analysis of flowering in response to environmental factors. The flowering of the line A17 was analysed in different conditions of temperature, duration of vernalization and photoperiod. Flowering was characterized using three descriptors at the axis level: the position of the first reproductive node (1RN), the date of beginning of flowering (DBF) and the florochron (RFa−1) corresponding to the reciprocal of the rate of progression of flowering along each axis. As for vegetative development, it was found that flowering could be analysed as a function of thermal time using a base temperature (Tb) of 5 °C. Vernalization displayed a sound impact on the flowering. For all the studied axes, increasing the duration of vernalization lowered the 1RN and hastened the DBF. By contrast, for most of the studied axes, RFa−1 was only slightly affected by vernalization. For the branch B0, RFa−1 was a genotypic constant when thermal time was used. Considering B0 as a reference axis, an ecophysiological model was developed to simulate the impact of environmental factors on the three components of flowering. Concrete practical applications of the model-based framework presented herein are proposed for helping the genetic and genomic studies of M. truncatula.},

	abstract = {At present, there is no simple, first principles–based, and general model for quantitatively describing the full range of observed biological temperature responses. Here we derive a general theory for temperature dependence in biology based on Eyring–Evans–Polanyi’s theory for chemical reaction rates. Assuming only that the conformational entropy of molecules changes with temperature, we derive a theory for the temperature dependence of enzyme reaction rates which takes the form of an exponential function modified by a power law and that describes the characteristic asymmetric curved temperature response. Based on a few additional principles, our model can be used to predict the temperature response above the enzyme level, thus spanning quantum to classical scales. Our theory provides an analytical description for the shape of temperature response curves and demonstrates its generality by showing the convergence of all temperature dependence responses onto universal relationships—a universal data collapse—under appropriate normalization and by identifying a general optimal temperature, around 25 ∘C, characterizing all temperature response curves. The model provides a good fit to empirical data for a wide variety of biological rates, times, and steady-state quantities, from molecular to ecological scales and across multiple taxonomic groups (from viruses to mammals). This theory provides a simple framework to understand and predict the impact of temperature on biological quantities based on the first principles of thermodynamics, bridging quantum to classical scales.},

	abstract = {Circadian rhythms have been demonstrated in organisms across the taxonomic spectrum. In view of their widespread occurrence, the adaptive significance of these rhythms is of interest. We have previously shown that constitutive expression of theCCA1 (CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1) gene in Arabidopsis plants (CCA1-ox) results in loss of circadian rhythmicity. Here, we demonstrate that these CCA1-ox plants retain the ability to respond to diurnal changes in light. Thus, transcript levels of several circadian-regulated genes, as well as CCA1 itself and the closely related LHY, oscillate robustly if CCA1-ox plants are grown under diurnal conditions. However, in contrast with wild-type plants in which transcript levels change in anticipation of the dark/light transitions, the CCA1-ox plants have lost the ability to anticipate this daily change in their environment. We have used CCA1-ox lines to examine the effects of loss of circadian regulation on the fitness of an organism. CCA1-ox plants flowered later, especially under long-day conditions, and were less viable under very short-day conditions than their wild-type counterparts. In addition, we demonstrate that two other circadian rhythm mutants, LHY-ox and elf3, have low-viability phenotypes. Our findings demonstrate the adaptive advantage of circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis.},

	abstract = {Circadian clocks maintain robust and accurate timing over a broad range of physiological temperatures, a characteristic termed temperature compensation. In Arabidopsis thaliana, ambient temperature affects the rhythmic accumulation of transcripts encoding the clock components TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1), GIGANTEA (GI), and the partially redundant genes CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY). The amplitude and peak levels increase for TOC1 and GI RNA rhythms as the temperature increases (from 17 to 27°C), whereas they decrease for LHY. However, as temperatures decrease (from 17 to 12°C), CCA1 and LHY RNA rhythms increase in amplitude and peak expression level. At 27°C, a dynamic balance between GI and LHY allows temperature compensation in wild-type plants, but circadian function is impaired in lhy and gi mutant plants. However, at 12°C, CCA1 has more effect on the buffering mechanism than LHY, as the cca1 and gi mutations impair circadian rhythms more than lhy at the lower temperature. At 17°C, GI is apparently dispensable for free-running circadian rhythms, although partial GI function can affect circadian period. Numerical simulations using the interlocking-loop model show that balancing LHY/CCA1 function against GI and other evening-expressed genes can largely account for temperature compensation in wild-type plants and the temperature-specific phenotypes of gi mutants.},

	abstract = {Plants adjust their architecture to optimize growth and reproductive success under changing climates. Hypocotyl elongation is a pivotal morphogenic trait that is profoundly influenced by light and temperature conditions. While hypocotyl photomorphogenesis has been well characterized at the molecular level, molecular mechanisms underlying hypocotyl thermomorphogenesis remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) conveys warm temperature signals to hypocotyl thermomorphogenesis. To investigate the roles of COP1 and its target ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) during hypocotyl thermomorphogenesis, we employed Arabidopsis mutants that are defective in their genes. Transgenic plants overexpressing the genes were also produced. We examined hypocotyl growth and thermoresponsive turnover rate of HY5 protein at warm temperatures under both light and dark conditions. Elevated temperatures trigger the nuclear import of COP1, thereby alleviating the suppression of hypocotyl growth by HY5. While the thermal induction of hypocotyl growth is circadian-gated, the degradation of HY5 by COP1 is uncoupled from light responses and timing information. We propose that thermal activation of COP1 enables coincidence between warm temperature signaling and circadian rhythms, which allows plants to gate hypocotyl thermomorphogenesis at the most profitable time at warm temperatures.},

Light and low temperatures are known to regulate the expression of the COLD REGULATED (COR) genes COR27 and COR28, which influence the circadian clock, freezing tolerance, and flowering time. Blue light stabilizes the COR27 and COR28 proteins, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. We therefore performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using COR27- and COR28 as bait and identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) as an interactor. COR27 and COR28 physically interact with COP1, which is in turn responsible for their degradation in the dark. Furthermore, COR27 and COR28 promote hypocotyl elongation and act as negative regulators of photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Genome-wide gene expression analysis showed that HY5, COR27, and COR28 co-regulate many common genes. COR27 interacts directly with HY5 and associates with the promoters of the HY5 target genes HY5 and PIF4, then regulates their transcription together with HY5. Our results demonstrate that COR27 and COR28 act as key regulators in the COP1–HY5 regulatory hub, by regulating the transcription of HY5 target genes together with HY5 to ensure proper skotomorphogenic growth in the dark and photomorphogenic development in the light.},

	abstract = {A great variety of legume species are used for forage production and grown in multi-species grasslands. Despite their close phylogenetic relationship, they display a broad range of morphologies that markedly affect their competitive abilities and persistence in mixtures. Little is yet known about the component traits that control the deployment of plant architecture in most of these species. During the present study, we compared the patterns of shoot organogenesis and shoot organ growth in contrasting forage species belonging to the four morphogenetic groups previously identified in herbaceous legumes (i.e., stolon-formers, rhizome-formers, crown-formers tolerant to defoliation and crown-formers intolerant to defoliation). To achieve this, three greenhouse experiments were carried out using plant species from each group (namely alfalfa, birdsfoot trefoil, sainfoin, kura clover, red clover, and white clover) which were grown at low density under non-limiting water and soil nutrient availability. The potential morphogenesis of shoots characterized under these conditions showed that all the species shared a number of common morphogenetic features. All complied with a generalized classification of shoot axes into three types (main axis, primary and secondary axes). A common quantitative framework for vegetative growth and development involved: (i) the regular development of all shoot axes in thermal time and a deterministic branching pattern in the absence of stress; (ii) a temporal coordination of organ growth at the phytomer level that was highly conserved irrespective of phytomer position, and (iii) an identical allometry determining the surface area of all the leaves. The species differed in their architecture as a consequence of the values taken by component traits of morphogenesis. Assessing the relationships between the traits studied showed that these species were distinct from each other along two main PCA axes which explained 68\% of total variance: the first axis captured a trade-off between maximum leaf size and the ability to produce numerous phytomers, while the second distinguished morphogenetic strategies reliant on either petiole or internode expansion to achieve space colonization. The consequences of this quantitative framework are discussed, along with its possible applications regarding plant phenotyping and modeling.},

Modelling can be a useful approach to consolidating our understanding across traditional research domains. The laboratory model species Arabidopsis is very widely used to study plant growth processes and has also been tested more recently in ecophysiology and population genetics. However, approaches from crop modelling that might link these domains are rarely applied to Arabidopsis. Here, we combine plant growth models with phenology models from ecophysiology, using the agent-based modelling language Chromar. We introduce a simpler Framework Model of vegetative growth for Arabidopsis, FM-lite. By extending this model to include inflorescence and fruit growth and seed dormancy, we present a whole-life-cycle, multi-model FM-life, which allows us to simulate at the population level in various genotype × environment scenarios. Environmental effects on plant growth distinguish between the simulated life history strategies that were compatible with previously described Arabidopsis phenology. Our results simulate reproductive success that is founded on the broad range of physiological processes familiar from crop models and suggest an approach to simulating evolution directly in future.},

The present study describes the first model of Arabidopsis growth integrating organogenesis, morphogenesis and carbon-partitioning processes for aerial and subterranean parts of the plant throughout its development. The objective was to analyse competition among sinks as they emerge from patterns of plant structural development. The model was adapted from the GreenLab model and was used to estimate organ sink strengths by optimisation against biomass measurements. Dry biomass production was calculated by a radiation use efficiency-based approach. Organogenesis processes were parameterised based on experimental data. The potential of this model for growth analysis was assessed using the Columbia ecotype, which was grown in standard environmental conditions. Three phases were observed in the overall time course of trophic competition within the plant. In the vegetative phase, no competition was observed. In the reproductive phase, competition increased with a strong increase when lateral inflorescences developed. Roots and internodes and structures bearing siliques were strong sinks and had a similar impact on competition. The application of the GreenLab model to the growth analysis of A. thaliana provides new insights into source–sink relationships as functions of phenology and morphogenesis.},

The seasonal timing, or phenology, of life-stage transitions determines the environmental conditions to which each life stage is exposed and the length of time required to complete a generation. Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to phenological variation, yet predicting their combined effect on life cycles across a geographic range remains a challenge. We linked submodels of the plasticity of individual life stages to create an integrated model that predicts life-cycle phenology in complex environments. We parameterized the model for Arabidopsis thaliana and simulated life cycles in four locations. We compared multiple “genotypes” by varying two parameters associated with natural genetic variation in phenology: seed dormancy and floral repression. The model predicted variation in life cycles across locations that qualitatively matches observed natural phenology. Seed dormancy had larger effects on life-cycle length than floral repression, and results suggest that a genetic cline in dormancy maintains a life-cycle length of 1 year across the geographic range of this species. By integrating across life stages, this approach demonstrates how genetic variation in one transition can influence subsequent transitions and the geographic distribution of life cycles more generally.},

	abstract = {Background Winter chill is one of the defining characteristics of a location's suitability for the production of many tree crops. We mapped and investigated observed historic and projected future changes in winter chill in California, quantified with two different chilling models (Chilling Hours, Dynamic Model). Methodology/Principal Findings Based on hourly and daily temperature records, winter chill was modeled for two past temperature scenarios (1950 and 2000), and 18 future scenarios (average conditions during 2041–2060 and 2080–2099 under each of the B1, A1B and A2 IPCC greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, for the CSIRO-MK3, HadCM3 and MIROC climate models). For each scenario, 100 replications of the yearly temperature record were produced, using a stochastic weather generator. We then introduced and mapped a novel climatic statistic, “safe winter chill”, the 10\% quantile of the resulting chilling distributions. This metric can be interpreted as the amount of chilling that growers can safely expect under each scenario. Winter chill declined substantially for all emissions scenarios, with the area of safe winter chill for many tree species or cultivars decreasing 50–75\% by mid-21st century, and 90–100\% by late century. Conclusions/Significance Both chilling models consistently projected climatic conditions by the middle to end of the 21st century that will no longer support some of the main tree crops currently grown in California, with the Chilling Hours Model projecting greater changes than the Dynamic Model. The tree crop industry in California will likely need to develop agricultural adaptation measures (e.g. low-chill varieties and dormancy-breaking chemicals) to cope with these projected changes. For some crops, production might no longer be possible.},

Our hypothesis is that these different formalisms and parameterization could emerge from common principles and a common response of plant development to temperature, but with several counfounding factors which are not taken into account. We first show that these calculations of thermal time are based on sound common principles and mathematical formalisms. We test, via a modelling exercise of nine case studies using maize plants grown in three field sites, how a given “ground truth” response of plant development rate to temperature can be affected if an experimenter either considers or ignores confounding factors. We also show that apparent differences in temperature responses between phenological stages of the growth cycle, between day and night, or between plant genotypes may be due to the confounding effects of evaporative demand, the range of temperatures, and the time interval at which measurements are taken. On the basis of our findings, we propose that the critical point in the use of a given formalism of thermal time calculation is to ensure that the chosen model is compatible with the temporal definition, temperature range, and environmental scenario in the considered dataset.},

	abstract = {Lucerne yield is affected by the amount of intercepted radiation and the efficiency with which is used (RUE). The canopy structure of lucerne is a function of the leaf area index (LAI) which can be divided into development (leaf appearance and branching) and growth (leaf area and shoot population) components. Leaf appearance rates (LAR) depend on temperature, but phyllochron is usually stable for similar photoperiods and declines as days get shorter (60 to 34°Cd). Branching is an important yield factor in lucerne and, as opposed to LAR, appears to increase in shorter photoperiods. Plant declines in lucerne are compensated by increases in shoots/plant but there is a threshold of plant density below which yield is compromised (43-132 plants/m2). Leaf area expansion rate (LAER) is the most plastic component of canopy development, and is mostly affected by water stress and partitioning to roots. Compared to other pastures, lucerne is better able to tolerate shade and has the potential to be included in a silvopastoral system. Including trees in dairy farms could decrease heat stress, thus increasing milk production and the farm revenue. However, more information is needed to understand the behavior of lucerne crops under tree canopies in subtropical environments and make more accurate recommendations.},

To understand the importance of these timing advances for a stable life history strategy, we constructed a full life cycle model of Arabidopsis thaliana. Modelling and field data reveal that a cryptic function of flowering time control is to limit seed set of winter annuals to an ambient temperature window which coincides with a temperature-sensitive switch in seed dormancy state. This coincidence is predicted to be conserved independent of climate at the expense of flowering date, suggesting that temperature control of flowering time has evolved to constrain seed set environment and therefore frequency of dormant and non-dormant seed states. We show that late flowering can disrupt this bet-hedging germination strategy. Our analysis shows that life history modelling can reveal hidden fitness constraints and identify non-obvious selection pressures as emergent features.},

	abstract = {Although multiple environmental cues regulate the transition to flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana, previous studies have suggested that wild A. thaliana accessions fall primarily into two classes, distinguished by their requirement for vernalization (extended winter-like temperatures), which enables rapid flowering under long days. Much of the difference in vernalization response is apparently due to variation at two epistatically acting loci, FRI and FLC. We present the response of over 150 wild accessions to three different environmental variables. In long days, FLC is among those genes whose expression is most highly correlated with flowering. In short days, FRI and FLC are less important, although their contribution is still significant. In addition, there is considerable variation not only in vernalization response, but also in the response to differences in day length or ambient growth temperature. The identification of accessions that flower relatively early or late in specific environments suggests that many of the flowering-time pathways identified by mutagenesis, such as those that respond to day length, contribute to flowering-time variation in the wild. In contrast to differences in vernalization requirement, which are mainly mediated by FRI and FLC, it seems that variation in these other pathways is due to allelic effects at several different loci.},

	abstract = {Arabidopsis seedlings display contrasting developmental patterns depending on the ambient light. Seedlings grown in the light develop photomorphogenically, characterized by short hypocotyls and expanded green cotyledons. In contrast, seedlings grown in darkness become etiolated, with elongated hypocotyls and closed cotyledons on an apical hook. Light signals, perceived by multiple photoreceptors and transduced to downstream regulators, dictate the extent of photomorphogenic development in a quantitative manner. Two key downstream components, COP1 and HY5, act antagonistically in regulating seedling development1. HY5 is a bZIP transcription factor that binds directly to the promoters of light-inducible genes, promoting their expression and photomorphogenic development2,3. COP1 is a RING-finger protein with WD-40 repeats whose nuclear abundance is negatively regulated by light4,5. COP1 interacts directly with HY5 in the nucleus to regulate its activity negatively1. Here we show that the abundance of HY5 is directly correlated with the extent of photomorphogenic development, and that the COP1–HY5 interaction may specifically target HY5 for proteasome-mediated degradation in the nucleus.},

COP1, when fused to beta-glucuronidase (GUS), is enriched in the nucleus in darkness, but not in the light, in hypocotyl cells of Arabidopsis seedlings and epidermal cells of onion bulbs. In Arabidopsis hypocotyl cells, the nuclear GUS-COP1 level changes in response to dark-light transitions and quantitatively correlates with the extent of repression of photomorphogenic development. In root cells, GUS-COP1 is constitutively nuclear, consistent with an established role of COP1 in suppressing root chloroplast development in both light and darkness. We conclude that COP1 acts inside the nucleus to suppress photomorphogenesis and that light inactivation of COP1 involves a cell type-specific control of its nucleocytoplasmic partitioning.},

	abstract = {Light and temperature are two key environmental signals that profoundly affect plant growth and development, but underlying molecular mechanisms of how light and temperature signals affect the circadian clock are largely unknown. Here, we report that COR27 and COR28 are regulated not only by low temperatures but also by light signals. COR27 and COR28 are negative regulators of freezing tolerance but positive regulators of flowering, possibly representing a trade-off between freezing tolerance and flowering. Furthermore, loss-of-function mutations in COR27 and COR28 result in period lengthening of various circadian output rhythms and affect central clock gene expression. Also, the cor27 cor28 double mutation affects the pace of the circadian clock. Additionally, COR27 and COR28 are direct targets of CCA1, which represses their transcription via chromatin binding. Finally, we report that COR27 and COR28 bind to the chromatin of TOC1 and PRR5 to repress their transcription, suggesting that their effects on rhythms are in part due to their regulation of TOC1 and PRR5. These data demonstrate that blue light and low temperature-regulated COR27 and COR28 regulate the circadian clock as well as freezing tolerance and flowering time.},

To cope with this adverse environmental cue, plants from temperate climates have evolved an array of sophisticated mechanisms to acclimate to cold periods, increasing their ability to tolerate freezing stress. Over the last decade, significant progress has been made in determining the molecular mechanisms underpinning cold acclimation, including following the identification of several pivotal components, including candidates for cold sensors, protein kinases, and transcription factors. With these developments, we have a better understanding of the CBF-dependent cold-signaling pathway. In this review, we summarize recent progress made in elucidating the cold-signaling pathways, especially the C-repeat binding factor-dependent pathway, and describe the regulatory function of the crucial components of plant cold signaling. We also discuss the unsolved questions that should be the focus of future work.},

Recommended as a 5-year award, funds were initially provided for 2 years with a subsequent 6-month extension to allow for the development of a plan for the continuation of funding that was acceptable to NSF. When funds were exhausted in 2016 with the continuation award still awaiting a decision, the Araport site continued in a maintenance mode with minimal input from legacy personnel at each institution and with no data updates. The renewal request was finally declined in December 2018, leaving Araport with an uncertain future. In light of the critical importance of these services to the scientific community, a group of interested researchers (see Appendix) met in March 2019 to discuss options and propose a solution. A working group evolved from those in attendance at that meeting and has since met monthly to solidify and coordinate the execution of these nascent plans. The results have been encouraging and are described here to inform and inspire the larger plant science community.},

TAIR's biocurators systematically extract, organize, and interconnect experimental data from the literature along with computational predictions, community submissions, and high throughput datasets to present a high quality and comprehensive picture of Arabidopsis gene function. TAIR provides tools for data visualization and analysis, and enables ordering of seed and DNA stocks, protein chips, and other experimental resources. TAIR actively engages with its users who contribute expertise and data that augments the work of the curatorial staff. TAIR's focus in an extensive and evolving ecosystem of online resources for plant biology is on the critically important role of extracting experimentally based research findings from the literature and making that information computationally accessible. In response to the loss of government grant funding, the TAIR team founded a nonprofit entity, Phoenix Bioinformatics, with the aim of developing sustainable funding models for biological databases, using TAIR as a test case. Phoenix has successfully transitioned TAIR to subscription-based funding while still keeping its data relatively open and accessible. genesis 53:474–485, 2015. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

              Floral transition is influenced by environmental factors such as light and temperature. Plants are capable of integrating photoperiod and ambient temperature signaling into their developmental program. Despite extensive investigations on individual genetic pathways, little is known about the molecular components that integrate both pathways. Here, we demonstrate that the RING finger–containing E3 ubiquitin ligase CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) acts as an integrator of photoperiod and ambient temperature signaling. In addition to the role in photoperiodic destabilization of CONSTANS (CO), COP1 also regulates temperature sensitivity by controlling the degradation of GIGANTEA (GI).
              COP1
              -impaired mutants showed reduced sensitivity to low ambient temperature. Notably, COP1 is more stabilized at low temperature and accelerates GI turnover in a 26S proteasome-dependent manner. The direct association of GI with the promoter of
              FLOWERING LOCUS T
              (
              FT
              ) was reduced because of its ambient temperature-dependent protein stability control and thus COP1-triggered GI turnover delays flowering at low temperatures
              via
              a CO-independent pathway. Taken together, our findings indicate that environmental conditions regulate the stability of COP1 and conditional specificity of its target selection stimulates proper developmental responses and ensures reproductive success.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present the R package deSolve to solve initial value problems (IVP) written as ordinary differential equations (ODE), differential algebraic equations (DAE) of index 0 or 1 and partial differential equations (PDE), the latter solved using the method of lines approach. The differential equations can be represented in R code or as compiled code. In the latter case, R is used as a tool to trigger the integration and post-process the results, which facilitates model development and application, whilst the compiled code significantly increases simulation speed. The methods implemented are efficient, robust, and well documented public-domain Fortran routines. They include four integrators from the ODEPACK package (LSODE, LSODES, LSODA, LSODAR), DVODE and DASPK2.0. In addition, a suite of Runge-Kutta integrators and special-purpose solvers to efficiently integrate 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional partial differential equations are available. The routines solve both stiff and non-stiff systems, and include many options, e.g., to deal in an efficient way with the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, or finding the root of equations. In this article, our objectives are threefold: (1) to demonstrate the potential of using R for dynamic modeling, (2) to highlight typical uses of the different methods implemented and (3) to compare the performance of models specified in R code and in compiled code for a number of test cases. These comparisons demonstrate that, if the use of loops is avoided, R code can efficiently integrate problems comprising several thousands of state variables. Nevertheless, the same problem may be solved from 2 to more than 50 times faster by using compiled code compared to an implementation using only R code. Still, amongst the benefits of R are a more flexible and interactive implementation, better readability of the code, and access to R’s high-level procedures. deSolve is the successor of package odesolve which will be deprecated in the future; it is free software and distributed under the GNU General Public License, as part of the R software project.},

The protein contains two B-box zinc-finger motives at the N terminus and a conserved motif at the C-terminal part required for the interaction with COP1. BBX24 accumulates during deetiolation of young seedlings in the first hours of exposure to light. However, this accumulation is transient and decreases after prolonged light irradiation. Here, we identified the amino acidic residues necessary for the nuclear import of the protein. In addition, we created mutated forms of the protein, and analyzed them by overexpression in the bbx24-1 mutant background. Our results indicate that the degradation of BBX24 occurs, or at least is initiated in the nucleus, and this nuclear localization is a prerequisite to fulfill its function in light signaling. Moreover, mutations in the region responsible for the interaction with COP1 revealed that a physical interaction of the proteins is also required for degradation of BBX24 in the light and for normal photomorphogenesis.},

	abstract = {The transition to flowering is an important event in the plant life cycle and is modulated by several environmental factors including photoperiod, light quality, vernalization, and growth temperature, as well as biotic and abiotic stresses. In contrast to light and vernalization, little is known about the pathways that mediate the responses to other environmental variables. A mild increase in growth temperature, from 23 °C to 27 °C, is equally efficient in inducing flowering of Arabidopsis plants grown in 8-h short days as is transfer to 16-h long days. There is extensive natural variation in this response, and we identify strains with contrasting thermal reaction norms. Exploiting this natural variation, we show that FLOWERING LOCUS C potently suppresses thermal induction, and that the closely related floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS M is a major-effect quantitative trait locus modulating thermosensitivity. Thermal induction does not require the photoperiod effector CONSTANS, acts upstream of the floral integrator FLOWERING LOCUS T, and depends on the hormone gibberellin. Analysis of mutants defective in salicylic acid biosynthesis suggests that thermal induction is independent of previously identified stress-signaling pathways. Microarray analyses confirm that the genomic responses to floral induction by photoperiod and temperature differ. Furthermore, we report that gene products that participate in RNA splicing are specifically affected by thermal induction. Above a critical threshold, even small changes in temperature can act as cues for the induction of flowering. This response has a genetic basis that is distinct from the known genetic pathways of floral transition, and appears to correlate with changes in RNA processing.},

Over the last 20 years, the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) has collected and developed a series of best-practice protocols, some of which are presented in this chapter. Arabidopsis can be grown in a variety of locations, growth media, and environmental conditions. Most laboratory accessions and their mutant or transgenic derivatives flower after 4–5 weeks and set seeds after 7–8 weeks, under standard growth conditions (soil, long day, 23 ºC). Some mutant genotypes, natural accessions, and Arabidopsis relatives require strict control of growth conditions best provided by growth rooms, chambers, or incubators. Other lines can be grown in less-controlled greenhouse settings. Although the majority of lines can be grown in soil, certain experimental purposes require utilization of sterile solid or liquid growth media. These include the selection of primary transformants, identification of homozygous lethal individuals in a segregating population, or bulking of a large amount of plant material. The importance of controlling, observing, and recording growth conditions is emphasized and appropriate equipment required to perform monitoring of these conditions is listed. Proper conditions for seed harvesting and preservation, as well as seed quality control, are also described. Plant transformation and genetic crosses, two of the methods that revolutionized Arabidopsis genetics, are introduced as well.},

	abstract = {Plants synchronize their life history events with proper seasonal conditions, and as the ﬁtness consequences of each life stage depend on previous and/or subsequent one, changes in environmental cues create cascading effects throughout their whole life cycle. For monocarpic plants, proper senescence timing is very important as the ﬁnal production of plants depends on it. Citing available literatures, this review discusses how plants not only may delay senescence until after they reproduce successfully, but they may also bring senescence time forward, in order to reproduce in favored conditions. It demonstrates that even though senescence is part of aging, it does not necessarily mean plants have to reach a certain age to senesce. Experiments using different aged plants have suggested that in interest of their ﬁnal outcome and ﬁtness, plants carefully weigh out environmental cues and transit to next developmental phase at proper time, even if that means transiting to terminal senescence phase earlier and shortening their lifespan. How much plants have control over senescence timing and how they balance internal and external signals for that is not well understood. Future studies are needed to identify processes that trigger senescence timing in response to environment and investigate genetic/epigenetic mechanisms behind it.},

              Synchronisation of flowering phenology has often been observed between individuals within plant species. We expected that a critical role of flowering-time control under natural conditions is a phenological synchronisation. However, no studies have quantified the level of synchronisation of reproductive timing relative to germination timing under natural conditions. In a sequential seeding experiment (SSE) in which we manipulated the germination timing of
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              accessions, we developed a quantification index to evaluate reproductive synchrony in annual plants. In the SSE, we identified a novel phenomenon of reproductive synchrony: senescence synchrony. The role of vernalisation in realising flowering synchrony between plants of different ages under natural conditions was demonstrated by synchronisation and de-synchronisation of flowering initiation in vernalisation-sensitive and less-vernalisation-sensitive accessions, respectively. We also observed up-regulation of senescence-related genes at corresponding times. The approach we developed in this study provides a set of concepts and procedures that can be used to study reproductive synchrony experimentally under natural conditions.},

The model predicts associations between inflorescence architecture, climate, and life history, which we validated empirically.

Accurate summarization of plant temperature response is thus a prerequisite to successful crop systems modelling and application of such models to management. This paper reports on a general equation that can be used to simulate the temperature response of plants. The equation reads asr=Rmax ( Tmax - TTmax - Topt ) ( TTopt ) ToptTmax - Topt ,  where r is the daily rate of growth (or development) at any temperature, Topt is the optimum temperature, Tmax is the maximum temperature, and Rmax is the maximum rate of growth or development at Topt . It has the smallest number of parameters possible to simulate the plant response to the full range of temperatures relevant to plant growth and development. The equation was shown to successfully simulate the growth and development of maize, bean, wheat, barley, sorghum, and lambsquarters. The adjusted R -square of fit ranged from 0.747 to 0.998, mostly greater than 0.9. For one maize dataset that contains independent data, the equation was shown to be highly predictive. The equation could find application in crop germplasm classification, crop modelling and environmental control of artificial crop production systems. Copyright 1999 Annals of Botany Company},

The seasonal timing, or phenology, of life-stage transitions determines the environmental conditions to which each life stage is exposed and the length of time required to complete a generation. Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to phenological variation, yet predicting their combined effect on life cycles across a geographic range remains a challenge. We linked submodels of the plasticity of individual life stages to create an integrated model that predicts life-cycle phenology in complex environments. We parameterized the model for Arabidopsis thaliana and simulated life cycles in four locations. We compared multiple “genotypes” by varying two parameters associated with natural genetic variation in phenology: seed dormancy and ﬂoral repression. The model predicted variation in life cycles across locations that qualitatively matches observed natural phenology. Seed dormancy had larger effects on life-cycle length than ﬂoral repression, and results suggest that a genetic cline in dormancy maintains a life-cycle length of 1 year across the geographic range of this species. By integrating across life stages, this approach demonstrates how genetic variation in one transition can inﬂuence subsequent transitions and the geographic distribution of life cycles more generally.},

Correlative controls, in which one part of the plant regulates the growth of another, form an important class of regulatory mechanism, but their study has been neglected, and their molecular basis remains unclear. In this article, we examine the role of negative correlative controls or ‘dominance’ phenomena in the regulation of shoot architecture. Apical dominance, in which actively growing shoot branches inhibit the growth of other branches, is perhaps the most famous example of this. We discuss the recent progress made in understanding the mechanistic basis for apical dominance and three plausible models for shoot branching control. We then use the apical dominance paradigm to explore other dominance phenomena, including seed–seed inhibition (carpic dominance), seed-to-meristem inhibition, and the control of maternal senescence by seeds. We propose that apical and carpic dominance may share a common mechanistic basis rooted in auxin transport canalisation. Conversely, we conclude that seed-to-meristem inhibition and seed-driven senescence may not be ‘true’ correlative controls, but rather more complex phenomena in which seed set plays a permissive rather than instructive role. Overall, we attempt to develop a coherent framework for understanding the developmental and regulatory mechanisms that control shoot architecture and provide new insights into the end of flowering, fruiting, and growth.},

	abstract = {After a vegetative phase, plants initiate the floral transition in response to both environmental and endogenous cues to optimize reproductive success. During this process, the vegetative shoot apical meristem (SAM), which was producing leaves and branches, becomes an inflorescence SAM and starts producing flowers. Inflorescences can be classified in two main categories, depending on the fate of the inflorescence meristem: determinate or indeterminate. In determinate inflorescences, the SAM differentiates directly, or after the production of a certain number of flowers, into a flower, while in indeterminate inflorescences the SAM remains indeterminate and produces continuously new flowers. Even though indeterminate inflorescences have an undifferentiated SAM, the number of flowers produced by a plant is not indefinite and is characteristic of each species, indicating that it is under genetic control. In Arabidopsis thaliana and other species with indeterminate inflorescences, the end of flower production occurs by a regulated proliferative arrest of inflorescence meristems on all reproductive branches that is reminiscent of a state of induced dormancy and does not involve the determination of the SAM. This process is controlled genetically by the FRUITFULL-APETALA2 (FUL-AP2) pathway and by a correlative control exerted by the seeds through a mechanism not well understood yet. In the absence of seeds, meristem proliferative arrest does not occur, and the SAM remains actively producing flowers until it becomes determinate, differentiating into a terminal floral structure. Here we show that the indeterminate growth habit of Arabidopsis inflorescences is a facultative condition imposed by the meristematic arrest directed by FUL and the correlative signal of seeds. The terminal differentiation of the SAM when seed production is absent correlates with the induction of AGAMOUS expression in the SAM. Moreover, terminal flower formation is strictly dependent on the activity of FUL, as it was never observed in ful mutants, regardless of the fertility of the plant or the presence/absence of the AG repression exerted by APETALA2 related factors.},

              Monocarpic plants have a single reproductive cycle in their lives, where life span is determined by the coordinated arrest of all meristems, or global proliferative arrest (GPA). The molecular bases for GPA and the signaling mechanisms involved are poorly understood, other than systemic cues from developing seeds of unknown nature. Here we uncover a genetic pathway regulating GPA in
              Arabidopsis
              that responds to age-dependent factors and acts in parallel to seed-derived signals. We show that

	abstract = {The relationship between fruit development and the proliferative capacities of inflorescence meristems has been examined in Arabidopsis fhaliana. In the wild-type Landsberg erecta (Ler) line, flower production ceases coordinately on all inflorescence branches by a process we have designated global proliferative arrest (GPA). Morphological studies indicate that GPA involves a cessation of proliferative activity at the meristems, but a retention of the structural characteristics of the proliferating meristems. GPA does not occur in the male-sterile (msl-7) line, nor in wild-type Ler when fruits are surgically removed. In these cases, inflorescence meristems continue to proliferate, ultimately terminating by a different process, designated terminal differentiation, in which disruptions in patterning at the apex are followed by the loss of the inflorescence meristem. We present an argument that GPA is mediated by a specific communication system between inflorescence meristems and developing fruits. Analysis of reduced-fertility mutants provided evidence that GPA is dependent on seed development specifically. Mutations conferring hormone deficiency or insensitivity did not disrupt the correlative interactions leading to GPA.},

Recent studies developed models that integrate temperature and photoperiod signals into the network of floral regulatory genes, and predicted the shortening of flowering duration under warming based on the expression dynamics of major flowering-time genes in the perennial herb Arabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera. Nevertheless, empirical testing of the model prediction is still lacking. We performed temperature manipulation experiments and common garden experiments to test the model predictions using plants from two distant populations of A. halleri. We also quantified expression levels of two major flowering-time genes and compared the observed and predicted gene expression patterns. Our experiments in the laboratory and the field demonstrated that flowering duration of A. halleri was significantly shortened under warming conditions. Our results also revealed that the end of flowering was more sensitive to the climate warming than the onset of flowering in A. halleri. The observed gene expression dynamics in the warming condition were predicted well by the gene regulatory model. The transplant experiment of plants from Hokkaido, the northernmost island, to the subtropical field site in Okinawa, Japan, showed that plants flowered without significant activation of FLOWERING LOCUS T, a floral integrator crucial for the accelerated flowering in long days. The study suggested that the redundancy of flowering gene regulatory network could be beneficial to the persistence of flowering ability under extreme climatic conditions.},

GPA is linked to the correlative control exerted by developing seeds and, possibly, the establishment of strong source-sink relationships. It has been proposed that the meristems that undergo arrest at the end of the reproductive phase behave at the transcriptomic level as dormant meristems, with low mitotic activity and high expression of abscisic acid response genes. Meristem arrest is also controlled genetically. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the MADS-box transcription factor FRUITFULL induces GPA by directly repressing genes of the APETALA2 (AP2) clade. The AP2 genes maintain shoot apical meristem (SAM) activity in part by keeping WUSCHEL expression active, but the mechanisms downstream of this pathway remain elusive. To identify target genes, we performed a transcriptomic analysis, inducing AP2 activity in meristems close to arrest. Our results suggest that AP2 controls meristem arrest by repressing genes related to axillary bud dormancy in the SAM and negative regulators of cytokinin signaling. In addition, our analysis indicates that genes involved in the response to environmental signals also respond to AP2, suggesting that it could modulate the end of flowering by controlling responses to both endogenous and exogenous signals. Our results support the previous observation that at the end of the reproductive phase the arrested SAM behaves as a dormant meristem, and they strongly support AP2 as a master regulator of this process.},

Furthermore, in many species, it will be months between plants generating flowers and setting seed. How can plants therefore produce an optimal seed-set relative to environmental resources when the “reproductive architecture” that supports seed-set needs to be elaborated so far in advance? Here, we address this question by investigating the spatio-temporal control of reproductive architecture in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and Brassica napus. We show that resource and resource-related signals such as substrate volume play a key role in determining the scale of reproductive effort, and that this is reflected in the earliest events in reproductive development, which broadly predict the subsequent reproductive effort. We show that a series of negative feedbacks both within and between developmental stages prevent plants from over-committing to early stages of development. These feedbacks create a highly plastic, homeostatic system in which additional organs can be produced in the case of reproductive failure elsewhere in the system. We propose that these feedbacks represent an “integrated dominance” mechanism that allows resource use to be correctly sequenced between developmental stages to optimize seed set.},

Parental Col plants were significantly more freezing-tolerant than C24 plants in both the acclimated and non-acclimated (NA) states. Mid-parent heterosis was observed in the F1 plants, both in the basic tolerance of non-adapted plants and in freezing tolerance after cold acclimation. Best-parent heterosis, on the other hand, was only found after cold acclimation. The heterosis effect was reduced in the F2 populations such that only mid-parent heterosis was evident. The leaf content of soluble sugars (fructose (Fru), glucose (Glc), sucrose (Suc) and raffinose (Raf)) increased dramatically in the F1 plants after cold acclimation as compared to the parental lines. The content of proline (Pro), however, was only moderately increased in the F1 plants under the same conditions. Correlation analyses showed that only Raf content was consistently related to leaf-freezing tolerance in both the acclimated and NA states. A quantification of mRNA levels in leaves of parental and F1 lines using quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed no clear indication for an involvement of the investigated genes (CBF (C-repeat binding factor)1, CBF2, (cold-regulated protein (COR) 6.6, COR15a, COR15b, COR47 and COR78) in the heterosis effect.},

We have designated this locus SSB1 (symptom development by SBLV infection). By using genetic markers, SSB1 was mapped to chromosome IV. The patterns of distribution and accumulation of SBLV in sensitive accessions were similar to those in the insensitive accessions. In addition, symptom development in S96 by SBLV infection was critically interrupted by the presence of the NahG gene, which encodes salicylic acid (SA) hydroxylase. These data suggest that symptom development in A. thaliana controlled by SSB1 is independent of the efficiency of SBLV multiplication and is dependent on SA signaling.},

	abstract = {Oil from oleaginous seeds is mainly composed of triacylglycerols. Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are major constituents of triacylglycerols in many seed oils and represent valuable feedstock for industrial purposes. To identify genetic factors governing natural variability in VLCFA biosynthesis, a quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis using a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between accessions Bay-0 and Shahdara was performed in Arabidopsis thaliana. Two fatty acid chain length ratio (CLR) QTL were identified, with one major locus, CLR.2, accounting for 77\% of the observed phenotypic variation. A fine mapping and candidate gene approach showed that a key enzyme of the fatty acid elongation pathway, the β-ketoacyl-CoA synthase 18 (KCS18), was responsible for the CLR.2 QTL detected between Bay-0 and Shahdara. Association genetics and heterologous expression in yeast cells identified a single point mutation associated with an alteration of KCS18 activity, uncovering the molecular bases for the modulation of VLCFA content in these two natural populations of Arabidopsis. Identification of this kcs18 mutant with altered activity opens new perspectives for the modulation of oil composition in crop plants.},

	abstract = {Natural accessions of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) differ in their ability to tolerate a loss of chloroplast translation. These differences can be attributed in part to variation in a duplicated nuclear gene (ACC2) that targets homomeric acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) to plastids. This functional redundancy allows limited fatty acid biosynthesis to occur in the absence of heteromeric ACCase, which is encoded in part by the plastid genome. In the presence of functional ACC2, tolerant alleles of several nuclear genes, not yet identified, enhance the growth of seedlings and embryos disrupted in chloroplast translation. ACC2 knockout mutants, by contrast, are hypersensitive. Here we describe an expanded search for hypersensitive accessions of Arabidopsis, evaluate whether all of these accessions are defective in ACC2, and characterize genotype-to-phenotype relationships for homomeric ACCase variants identified among 855 accessions with sequenced genomes. Null alleles with ACC2 nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, small deletions, genomic rearrangements, and defects in RNA splicing are included among the most sensitive accessions examined. By contrast, most missense mutations affecting highly conserved residues failed to eliminate ACC2 function. Several accessions were identified where sensitivity could not be attributed to a defect in either ACC2 or Tic20-IV, the chloroplast membrane channel required for ACC2 uptake. Overall, these results underscore the central role of ACC2 in mediating Arabidopsis response to a loss of chloroplast translation, highlight future applications of this system to analyzing chloroplast protein import, and provide valuable insights into the mutational landscape of an important metabolic enzyme that is highly conserved throughout eukaryotes.},

The parental lines have similar rhythmic periods, but the progeny of crosses among them reveal extensive variation for this trait. An analysis of 48 Ler/Cvi recombinant inbred lines (RILs) and a further 30 Ler/Col RILs allowed us to locate four putative quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control the period of the circadian clock. Near-isogenic lines (NILs) that contain a QTL in a small, defined chromo- somal region allowed us to confirm the phenotypic effect and to map the positions of three period QTLs, designated ESPRESSO, NON TROPPO and RALENTANDO. Quantitative trait loci at the locations of RALENTANDO and of a fourth QTL, ANDANTE, were identified in both Ler/Cvi and Ler/Col RIL populations. Some QTLs for circadian period are closely linked to loci that control flowering time, including FLC. We show that flc mutations shorten the circadian period such that the known allelic variation in the MADS-box gene FLC can account for the ANDANTE QTL. The QTLs ESPRESSO and RALENTANDO identify new genes that regulate the Arabidopsis circadian system in nature, one of which may be the flowering-time gene GIGANTEA.},

Our data support the identification of FRI and FLC as candidates for the major-effect QTL underlying variation in vernalization response, and identify a weak FLC allele, caused by a Mutator-like transposon, contributing to flowering time variation in two N. American accessions. They also reveal a number of additional QTL that contribute to flowering time variation after saturating vernalization. One of these was the result of expression variation at the FT locus. Overall, our data suggest that distinct phenotypic variation in the vernalization and flowering response of Arabidopsis accessions is accounted for by variation that has arisen independently at relatively few major-effect loci.},

AFLP markers were also analysed in the Landsberg erecta/Columbia (Ler/Col) RIL population ( Lister \& Dean 1993) and 395 AFLP markers have been integrated into the previous Arabidopsis molecular map of 122 RFLPs, CAPSs and SSLPs. This enabled the evaluation of the efficiency and robustness of AFLP technology for linkage analyses in Arabidopsis. AFLP markers were found throughout the linkage map. The two RIL maps could be integrated through 49 common markers which all mapped at similar positions. Comparison of both maps led to the conclusion that segregating bands from a common parent can be compared between different populations, and that AFLP bands of similar molecular size, amplified with the same primer combination in two different ecotypes, are likely to correspond to the same locus. AFLPs were found clustering around the centromeric regions, and the authors have established the map position of the centromere of chromosome 3 by a quantitative analysis of AFLP bands using trisomic plants. AFLP markers were also used to estimate the polymorphism rate among the three ecotypes. The larger polymorphism rate found between Ler and Cvi compared to Ler and Col will mean that the new RIL population will provide a useful material to map DNA polymorphisms and quantitative trait loci.},

	abstract = {Deciphering the genetic basis underlying agronomic traits is of importance for soybean improvement. However, covariation, modulated by genetic correlations between complicated traits via hub QTLs, commonly affects the efficiency and accuracy of soybean improvement. The goals of soybean improvement have nearly all focused on agronomic traits, including yield, plant type traits, and seed-related traits especially. To decipher the hub QTLs of yield, plant type, and seed, nine pertinent traits of an F2 population (181 plants) derived from a cross between KeXin No.03 and JiDou 17, which were different in multiple traits such as plant height, seed protein, and 100-seed weight, were investigated with a high-density genetic map covering 2708.63 cM. A highly significant negative phenotypic correlation (−0.95) was found between seed protein (Pro) and seed oil (Oil). A total of 35 final QTLs after combining the ones closely linked physically were identified for eight traits explaining from 0.10\% to 24.63\% of the phenotypic variance explained (PVE) using composite interval mapping (CIM) and inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) procedures, and 13 QTLs were novel genes. A genomic region on chromosome 14 (qPro14, qOil14.2, and qSw14) was associated with three seed-related traits based on the relationship within and among the three trait modules. In addition, four genomic regions were detected as hub QTLs which linked to the seed-related module and plant-type model, including the E loci (E1 and E2). From the QTL results, 31 candidate genes were annotated, including the verified genes E1, E2, and QNE1, and they were grouped into three categories of biological processes. These results illustrate the genetic architecture as correlations among various soybean traits, and the hub QTLs should provide insights into the genetic improvement of complex traits in soybean.},

Mapping and isolation of QTLs is important for efficient crop breeding by marker-assisted selection (MAS) and for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the traits. However, since it requires the development and selection of DNA markers for linkage analysis, QTL analysis has been time-consuming and labor-intensive. Here we report the rapid identification of plant QTLs by whole-genome resequencing of DNAs from two populations each composed of 20–50 individuals showing extreme opposite trait values for a given phenotype in a segregating progeny. We propose to name this approach QTL-seq as applied to plant species. We applied QTL-seq to rice recombinant inbred lines and F2 populations and successfully identified QTLs for important agronomic traits, such as partial resistance to the fungal rice blast disease and seedling vigor. Simulation study showed that QTL-seq is able to detect QTLs over wide ranges of experimental variables, and the method can be generally applied in population genomics studies to rapidly identify genomic regions that underwent artificial or natural selective sweeps.},

	abstract = {Human activity and climate change are increasingly driving species, which were once separate together, leading to the potential for gene ﬂow. Hybridization between diverged species brings together two genomes which have evolved to meet different adaptive requirements. The unique combination of these traits in a hybrid may be beneﬁcial or maladaptive, but either way it results in increased phenotypic variation. A percentage of hybrid individuals may, therefore, ﬁnd themselves able to exploit environmental niches which their progenitors cannot, leading to invasive hybrid swarms becoming established in new habitats. Previous research into hybrids, most famously that of Loren Rieseberg and co-workers (Rieseberg et al. 1999, 2003) in sunﬂowers, demonstrated that hybridization can give rise to transgressive segregation of adaptive traits, wherein the combination of favourable alleles from both parents in hybrids can enable them to outperform either. However, the question still remains as to how much of the competitive ability of hybrids is a direct result of admixture and how much is the result of selection after the fact. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, (Czypionka et al. 2012) describe their study of transcriptional changes resulting from hybridization in a ﬁsh hybrid termed invasive sculpins (Cottus). Using gene expression microarray assays, they compare gene expression in both wild and lab-reared invasive hybrids to the progenitor species and experimentally produced F2 hybrids. They demonstrate that whilst hybridization alone does result in higher variance in gene expression (some of which is transgressive), many of the transgressive changes distinguishing the invasives appear to have come about subsequent to the initial natural hybridization event. They speculate that initial success of the hybrids in their new habitat is facilitated by hybridization, but that optimization of the invasive phenotype and removal of maladaptive traits rapidly reduces the variation in gene expression seen in early hybrids.},

	abstract = {Arabidopsis thaliana provides a useful model system for functional, evolutionary and ecological studies in plant biology. We have analysed natural genetic variation in A. thaliana in order to infer its biogeographical and historical distribution across Eurasia. We analysed 79 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers in 142 accessions from the species’ native range, and found highly significant genetic isolation by distance among A. thaliana accessions from Eurasia and southern Europe. These spatial patterns of genetic variation suggest that A. thaliana colonized central and northern Europe from Asia and from Mediterranean Pleistocene refugia, a trend which has been identified in other species. Statistically significant levels of multilocus linkage disequilibrium suggest intermediate levels of disequilibrium among subsets of loci, and analysis of genetic relationships among accessions reveal a star or bush-like dendrogram with low bootstrap support. Taken together, it appears that there has been sufficient historical recombination in the A. thaliana genome such that accessions do not conform to a tree-like, bifurcating pattern of evolution – there is no ‘ecotype phylogeny.’ Nonetheless, significant isolation by distance provides a framework upon which studies of natural variation in A. thaliana may be designed and interpreted.},

Although human migrations have been studied in great detail with modern and ancient genomes, recent anthropogenic influence on reducing the biogeographical constraints on the migration of nonnative species has presented opportunities in several study systems to ask the questions about how repeated introductions shape genetic diversity in the introduced range. We present an extensive overview of population structure of North American Arabidopsis thaliana by studying a set of 500 whole-genome sequenced and over 2,800 RAD-seq genotyped individuals in the context of global diversity represented by Afro-Eurasian genomes. We use methods based on haplotype and rare-allele sharing as well as phylogenetic modeling to identify likely sources of introductions of extant N. American A. thaliana from the native range in Africa and Eurasia. We find evidence of admixture among the introduced lineages having increased haplotype diversity and reduced mutational load. We also detect signals of selection in immune-system-related genes that may impart qualitative disease resistance to pathogens of bacterial and oomycete origin. We conclude that multiple introductions to a nonnative range can rapidly enhance the adaptive potential of a colonizing species by increasing haplotypic diversity through admixture. Our results lay the foundation for further investigations into the functional significance of admixture.},

Thus, it is exposed to a wide range of environmental factors and has been subject to natural selection under distinct conditions. Full genome sequencing data for more than 1000 different natural inbred lines are available, and this has encouraged the distributed generation of many types of phenotypic data. To leverage these data for meta analyses, AraPheno (https://arapheno.1001genomes.org) provide a central repository of population-scale phenotypes for A. thaliana inbred lines.

In annual plants, the inhibition of inﬂorescence growth by fruit load occurs at a late stage of inﬂorescence development termed the end of ﬂowering transition. Physiological studies show this transition is mediated by production and export of auxin from developing fruits in close proximity to the inﬂorescence apex. In the meristem, cessation of inﬂorescence growth is controlled in part by the age-dependent pathway, which regulates the timing of arrest. Here, we show the end of ﬂowering transition is a two-step process in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The ﬁrst stage is characterized by a cessation of inﬂorescence growth, while immature fruit continues to develop. At this stage, dominance inhibition of inﬂorescence growth by fruit load is associated with a selective dampening of auxin transport in the apical region of the stem. Subsequently, an increase in auxin response in the vascular tissues of the apical stem where developing fruits are attached marks the second stage for the end of ﬂowering transition. Similar to the vegetative and ﬂoral transition, the end of ﬂowering transition is associated with a change in sugar signaling and metabolism in the inﬂorescence apex. Taken together, our results suggest that during the end of ﬂowering transition, dominance inhibition of inﬂorescence shoot growth by fruit load is mediated by auxin and sugar signaling.},

In Arabidopsis, the transcriptional response to cytokinin is regulated by action of type-B Arabidopsis response regulators (ARRs). Although central elements in the cytokinin signal transduction pathway have been identified, mechanisms controlling output remain to be elucidated. Here we demonstrate that a family of F-box proteins, called the kiss me deadly (KMD) family, targets type-B ARR proteins for degradation. KMD proteins form an S-phase kinase-associated PROTEIN1 (SKP1)/Cullin/F-box protein (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and directly interact with type-B ARR proteins. Loss-of-function KMD mutants stabilize type-B ARRs and exhibit an enhanced cytokinin response. In contrast, plants with elevated KMD expression destabilize type-B ARR proteins leading to cytokinin insensitivity. Our results support a model in which an SCF(KMD) complex negatively regulates cytokinin responses by controlling levels of a key family of transcription factors.},

Here, we reveal that the levels of two forms of reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide anion free radical (O2·−) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), show dynamic changes in the shoot apex during the plant life cycle of Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that the level of O2·− decreased and disappeared at four weeks after bolting (WAB), while H2O2 appeared at 3 WAB and showed a burst at 5 WAB. The timing of dynamic changes in O2·− and H2O2 was delayed for approximately three weeks in clv3-2, which has a longer lifespan. Moreover, exogenous application of H2O2 inhibited the expression of the stem cell determinant WUSCHEL (WUS) and promoted the expression of the developmentally programmed cell death (dPCD) marker gene ORESARA 1 (ORE1). These results indicate that H2O2 triggers an important signal inducing dPCD in stem cells. Given that O2·− plays roles in maintaining WUS expression and stem cell activity, we speculate that the dynamic shift from O2·− to H2O2 in the shoot apex results in stem cell death. Our ﬁndings provide novel insights for understanding ROS-mediated regulation during plant stem cell death.},

Further analysis of pot size effects on the underlying components of growth suggests that reduced growth in smaller pots is caused mainly by a reduction in photosynthesis per unit leaf area, rather than by changes in leaf morphology or biomass allocation. The appropriate pot size will logically depend on the size of the plants growing in them. Based on various lines of evidence we suggest that an appropriate pot size is one in which the plant biomass does not exceed 1 g L–1. In current research practice {\textasciitilde}65\% of the experiments exceed that threshold. We suggest that researchers need to carefully consider the pot size in their experiments, as small pots may change experimental results and defy the purpose of the experiment.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient that affects multiple plant developmental processes, including flowering. As flowering requires resources to develop sink tissues for reproduction, nutrient availability is tightly linked to this process. Low N levels accelerate floral transition; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this response are not well understood. Here, we identify the FLOWERING BHLH 4 (FBH4) transcription factor as a key regulator of N-responsive flowering in Arabidopsis. Low N-induced early flowering is compromised in fbh quadruple mutants. We found that FBH4 is a highly phosphorylated protein and that FBH4 phosphorylation levels decrease under low N conditions. In addition, decreased phosphorylation promotes FBH4 nuclear localization and transcriptional activation of the direct target CONSTANS (CO) and downstream florigen FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) genes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the evolutionarily conserved cellular fuel sensor SNF1-RELATED KINASE 1 (SnRK1), whose kinase activity is down-regulated under low N conditions, directly phosphorylates FBH4. SnRK1 negatively regulates CO and FT transcript levels under high N conditions. Together, these results reveal a mechanism by which N levels may fine-tune FBH4 nuclear localization by adjusting the phosphorylation state to modulate flowering time. In addition to its role in flowering regulation, we also showed that FBH4 was involved in low N-induced up-regulation of nutrient recycling and remobilization-related gene expression. Thus, our findings provide insight into N-responsive growth phase transitions and optimization of plant fitness under nutrient-limited conditions.},

              Climate warming can shift the reproductive phenology of plant and hence dramatically reduced the reproductive capacity both of density-dependent and -independent plant species. But it is still unclear how climate warming affects flowering phenology and reproductive allocation of plant under different planting densities. Here, we assessed the impact of simulated warming on flowering phenology and sexual reproduction in the ephemeral herb
              Cardamine hirsuta
              under four densities. We found that simulated warming delayed the onset of flowering averagely for 3.6 days but preceded the end of flowering for about 1 day, which indicated climate warming shortened the duration of the flowering. And the flowering amplitude in the peak flowering day also dramatically increased in the simulated warming treatment, which caused a mass-flowering pattern. Climate warming significantly increased the weights of the fruits, seeds and seed, but reduced fruit length and sexual reproductive allocation under all the four densities. The duration of flowering was shortened and the weights of the fruits, seeds and seed and sexual reproductive allocation were reduced under The highest density.},

Nitrate and nitrogen have been reported to regulate flowering; while some studies have shown that lower nitrate/nitrogen promoted flowering, others have reported the opposite trend. To elucidate how nitrate/nitrogen affects flowering, we reviewed the existing literature and conducted experiments to examine flowering time under a wide range of nitrate concentrations using two growth systems. From the literature review and our experiments, we established that differing nitrate availability results in a U-shaped flowering curve, with an optimal concentration of nitrate facilitating flowering and concentrations above or below this optimal concentration delaying flowering. The role of nitrate and nitrogen in regulating flowering has been elucidated by several transcriptomic and mutant studies, which have suggested close interactions between nitrate/ nitrogen, phosphate, the circadian clock, photosynthesis, and, potentially, hormones. We discuss several possible molecular mechanisms underlying the U-shaped flowering response.},

Inflorescence shape and organization is genetically established during the early stages of reproductive development and depends on the number, arrangement, activities, and duration of meristems during the reproductive phase of the plant life cycle. Despite the variety of inflorescence architectures observable in nature, many key aspects of inflorescence development are conserved among different species. For instance, the genetic network in charge of specifying the identity of the different reproductive meristems, which can be indeterminate or determinate, seems to be similar among distantly related species. The availability of a large number of published transcriptomic datasets for plants with different inflorescence architectures, allowed us to identify transcription factor gene families that are differentially expressed in determinate and indeterminate reproductive meristems. The data that we review here for Arabidopsis, rice, barley, wheat, and maize, particularly deepens our knowledge of their involvement in meristem identity specification.},

	abstract = {Vascular plants, unlike bryophytes, have a strong root-shoot dichotomy in which the tissue systems are mutually interdependent; roots are completely dependent on shoots for photosynthetic sugars, and shoots are completely dependent on roots for water and mineral nutrients. Long-distance communication between shoot and root is therefore critical for the growth, development and survival of vascular plants, especially with regard to variable environmental conditions. However, this long-distance signalling does not appear an ancestral feature of land plants, and has likely arisen in vascular plants to service the radical alterations in body-plan seen in this taxon. In this review, we examine the deﬁned hormonal root-to-shoot and shoot-to-root signalling pathways that coordinate the growth of vascular plants, with a particular view to understanding how these pathways may have evolved. We highlight the completely divergent roles of isopentenyl-adenine and trans-zeatin cytokinin species in long-distance signalling, and ask whether cytokinin can really be considered as a single class of hormones in the light of recent research. We also discuss the puzzlingly sparse evidence for auxin as a shoot-to-root signal, the evolutionary re-purposing of strigolactones and gibberellins as hormonal signals, and speculate on the possible role of sugars as long-distance signals. We conclude by discussing the ‘design principles’ of long-distance signalling in vascular plants.},

It is also a highly complex trait controlled by dozens of genes. Understanding the selective pressures influencing time to flowering, and being able to reliably predict how it will evolve in novel environments, are unsolved challenges for plant evolutionary geneticists. Using the model plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana, we examined the impact of simulated high and low winter precipitation levels on the flowering time of naturalized lines from across the eastern portion of the introduced North American range, and the fitness consequences of early versus late flowering. Flowering time order was significantly correlated across two environments—in a previous common garden experiment and in environmental chambers set to mimic mid-range photoperiod and temperature conditions. Plants in low water flowered earlier, had fewer basal branches and produced fewer fruits. Selection in both treatments favored earlier flowering and more basal branches. Our analyses revealed an interaction between flowering time and water treatment for fitness, where flowering later was more deleterious for fitness in the low water treatment. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that differences in winter precipitation levels are one of the selective agents underlying a flowering time cline in introduced A. thaliana populations.},

	abstract = {Background
Characterization of the dynamic response of plant transpiration to decreasing soil water content in a reproducible way is required for the correct phenotyping of traits related to water saving strategies. Nowadays, an increasing number of automated high throughput platforms are available, but their development requires a great economic investment and it is not always desirable/feasible to outsource these analyses. We propose a medium-throughput protocol to characterize transpiration responses to decreasing soil moisture in a quantitative and highly reproducible way with a minimum investment of resources.

Results
The quantitative characterization of plant responses to a decreasing soil water content using our phenotyping platform has showed high reproducibility between different experiments. The proposed irrigation strategy allowed us to harvest plants ranging from a well-watered condition to the loss-of-turgor point in a predictable and controlled way. Coupling this protocol with hormone profiling allows investigation of hormonal responses (metabolite accumulation as well as plant sensitivity) to water stress. As a proof-of-concept, we have characterized the dynamic responses of leaf transpiration to decreasing soil water contents in an abscisic acid (ABA) deficient genotype (aba1-1) as well as in genotypes with altered sensitivity to ABA (abi1-1 and hab1-1abi1-1), which are insensitive and hypersensitive to ABA, respectively.

Conclusions
This protocol allows for assessment of quantitative differences in rosette transpiration responses to water depletion in both ABA biosynthesis mutants and genotypes with altered sensitivity to the hormone. Data indicate a correlation between ABA levels and/or hormone perception and growth rate and/or water content. The protocol guarantees the correct application of water stress to adult plants, which is essential to understand responses of mutants and/or natural accessions.

	abstract = {Plants need abundant nitrogen and phosphorus for higher yield. Improving plant genetics for higher nitrogen and phosphorus use efficiency would save potentially billions of dollars annually on fertilizers and reduce global environmental pollution. This will require knowledge of molecular regulators for maintaining homeostasis of these nutrients in plants. Previously, we reported that the NITROGEN LIMITATION ADAPTATION (NLA) gene is involved in adaptive responses to low-nitrogen conditions in Arabidopsis, where nla mutant plants display abrupt early senescence. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying NLA function, two suppressors of the nla mutation were isolated that recover the nla mutant phenotype to wild type. Map-based cloning identified these suppressors as the phosphate (Pi) transport-related genes PHF1 and PHT1.1. In addition, NLA expression is shown to be regulated by the low-Pi induced microRNA miR827. Pi analysis revealed that the early senescence in nla mutant plants was due to Pi toxicity. These plants accumulated over five times the normal Pi content in shoots specifically under low nitrate and high Pi but not under high nitrate conditions. Also the Pi overaccumulator pho2 mutant shows Pi toxicity in a nitrate-dependent manner similar to the nla mutant. Further, the nitrate and Pi levels are shown to have an antagonistic crosstalk as displayed by their differential effects on flowering time. The results demonstrate that NLA and miR827 have pivotal roles in regulating Pi homeostasis in plants in a nitrate-dependent fashion.},

The number of leaves and phyllochron are considered determinants of flowering time and the numerical components of yield include spikelets per spike and fertile floret number within spikelets. We studied the dynamics of leaf, spikelet, and floret development in near isogenic lines with either late or early alleles of Eps-D1 under seven temperature regimes. Leaf appearance dynamics were modulated by temperature, and Eps alleles had a greater effect on the period from flag leaf to heading than phyllochron. In addition, the effects of the Eps alleles on spikelets per spike were minor, and more related to spikelet plastochron than the duration of the early reproductive phase. However, fertile floret number was affected by the interaction between Eps alleles and temperature. So, at 9 °C, Eps-early alleles had more fertile florets than Eps-late alleles, at intermediate temperatures there was no significant difference, and at 18 °C (the highest temperature) the effect was reversed, with lines carrying the late allele producing more fertile florets. These effects were mediated through changes in floret survival; there were no clear effects on the maximum number of floret primordia.},

	abstract = {Flowering is regulated by genes that respond to changing daylengths and temperature, which have been well studied using controlled conditions; however, the molecular processes underpinning flowering in nature remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the genetic pathways that coordinate flowering and inflorescence development of wheat (Triticum aestivum) as daylengths extend naturally in the field, using lines that contain variant alleles for the key photoperiod gene, Photoperiod-1 (Ppd-1). We found flowering involves a stepwise increase in the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (FT1), which initiates under day-neutral conditions of early spring. The incremental rise in FT1 expression is overridden in plants that contain a photoperiod-insensitive allele of Ppd-1, which hastens the completion of spikelet development and accelerates flowering time. The accelerated inflorescence development of photoperiod-insensitive lines is promoted by advanced seasonal expression of floral meristem identity genes. The completion of spikelet formation is promoted by FLOWERING LOCUS T2, which regulates spikelet number and is activated by Ppd-1. In wheat, flowering under natural photoperiods is regulated by stepwise increases in the expression of FT1, which responds dynamically to extending daylengths to promote early inflorescence development. This research provides a strong foundation to improve yield potential by fine-tuning the photoperiod-dependent control of inflorescence development.},

In model plants, these environmental signals have been shown to include photoperiod, vernalization, and ambient temperature pathways, and in crop species, the integration of the ambient temperature pathway remains less well understood. In hexaploid wheat, at least 5 FT-like genes have been identified, each with a copy on the A, B, and D genomes. Here, we report the characterization of FT-B1 through analysis of FT-B1 null and overexpression genotypes under different ambient temperature conditions. This analysis has identified that the FT-B1 alleles perform differently under diverse environmental conditions; most notably, the FT-B1 null produces an increase in spikelet and tiller number when grown at lower temperature conditions. Additionally, absence of FT-B1 facilitates more rapid germination under both light and dark conditions. These results provide an opportunity to understand the FT-dependent pathways that underpin key responses of wheat development to changes in ambient temperature. This is particularly important for wheat, for which development and grain productivity are sensitive to changes in temperature.},

In wheat, vernalization predominantly involves the cold upregulation of the floral activator VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1). Here, we have used an extreme vernalization response, identified through studying ambient temperature responses, to reveal the complexity of temperature inputs into VRN-A1, with allelic inter-copy variation at a gene expansion of VRN-A1 modulating these effects. We find that the repressors of the reproductive transition, VERNALIZATION2 (VRN2) and ODDSOC2, are re-activated when plants experience high temperatures during and after vernalization. In addition, this re-activation is regulated by photoperiod for VRN2 but was independent of photoperiod for ODDSOC2. We also find this warm temperature interruption affects flowering time and floret number and is stage specific. This research highlights the important balance between floral activators and repressors in coordinating the response of a plant to temperature, and that the absence of warmth is essential for the completion of vernalization. This knowledge can be used to develop agricultural germplasm with more predictable vernalization responses that will be more resilient to variable growth temperatures.},

The central spikelets produce the highest number of grains, while apical and basal spikelets are less productive, and the most basal spikelets are commonly only developed in rudimentary form. Basal spikelets are delayed in initiation, yet they continue to develop and produce florets. The precise timing or the cause of their abortion remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the underlying causes of basal spikelet abortion using shading applications in the field. We found that basal spikelet abortion is likely to be the consequence of complete floret abortion, as both occur concurrently and have the same response to shading treatments. We detected no differences in assimilate availability across the spike. Instead, we show that the reduced developmental age of basal florets pre-anthesis is strongly associated with their increased abortion. Using the developmental age pre-abortion, we were able to predict final grain set per spikelet across the spike, alongside the characteristic gradient in the number of grains from basal to central spikelets. Future efforts to improve spikelet homogeneity across the spike could thus focus on improving basal spikelet establishment and increasing floret development rates pre-abortion.},

Dynamic plant (e.g., leaf area, plant height) and floret (e.g., anther and ovary size) growth and its connection with grain yield traits (e.g., grain number and width) are not clearly understood. In this study, for the first time, we dissected the SEP into seven stages to investigate plant (first experiment) and floret (second experiment) growth in greenhouse- and field-grown wheat. In the first experiment, the values of various plant growth trait indices at different stages were generally consistent between field and greenhouse and were independent of the environment. However, at specific stages, some traits significantly differed between the two environments. In the second experiment, phenotypic and genotypic similarity analysis revealed that grain number and size corresponded closely to ovary size at anthesis, suggesting that ovary size is strongly associated with grain number and size. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the top six principal components PCs explained 99.13, 98.61, 98.41, 98.35, and 97.93\% of the total phenotypic variation at the green anther, yellow anther, tipping, heading, and anthesis stages, respectively. The cumulative variance explained by the first PC decreased with floret growth, with the highest value detected at the green anther stage (88.8\%) and the lowest at the anthesis (50.09\%). Finally, ovary size at anthesis was greater in wheat accessions with early release years than in accessions with late release years, and anther/ovary size shared closer connections with grain number/size traits at the late vs. early stages of floral development. Our findings shed light on the dynamic changes in plant and floret growth-related traits in wheat and the effects of the environment on these traits.},

observed in other Brassicaceae (including Arabidopsis) and far beyond, including transitions from a diploid, self-incompatible, obligatory outcrossing species with comparatively
large and attractive flowers but a restricted distribution to a polyploid, self-compatible, predominantly selfing, invasive
species with floral reductions. All these evolutionary transitions may have contributed to the fact that Capsella bursa-pastoris (shepherd's purse) has become one of the most widely distributed flowering plants on our planet. In addition, Capsella bursa-pastoris shows a phenomenon that, although rare, could be of great evolutionary importance, specifically the occurrence of a homeotic
variety found in relatively stable populations in the wild. Several lines of evidence suggest that homeotic changes played
a considerable role in floral evolution, but how floral homeotic varieties are established in natural populations has remained
a highly controversial topic among evolutionary biologists. Due to its close relationship with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, numerous experimental tools are available for studying the genus Capsella, and further tools are currently being developed. Hence, Capsella provides great opportunities to investigate the evolution of flower development from molecular developmental genetics to
field ecology and biogeography, and from morphological refinements to major structural transitions.},

In addition, we quantitatively evaluated the relationship between phenotypic plasticity and fruit production. Most measured morphological and physiological traits exhibited plastic responses to temperature and fitness based on fruit production was maintained across temperatures. In contrast, no plasticity to soil moisture was detected, and plants produced fewer fruits in dry soil. Selection analysis revealed that the plasticity of the flowering time and the water-use efficiency had positive effects on fruit production over the tested temperature regime. These experimental results suggest that phenotypic plasticity probably enables C. bursa-pastoris to cope with heterogeneous temperature environments and thereby probably contributes to its wide geographic range.},

Arabidopsis fruit development is controlled by a network of interacting regulatory genes. Among them, the INDEHISCENT (IND) gene is a key regulator of the valve-margin tissue that mediates fruit opening, hence facilitating fruit dehiscence. We demonstrated that the valve-margin development is accelerated at higher temperature and that IND is targeted for thermosensory control. Our results reveal that IND upregulation is facilitated via temperature-induced chromatin dynamics leading to accelerated valve-margin specification and dispersal of the seed. Specifically, we show that temperature-induced changes in IND expression are associated with thermosensory H2A.Z nucleosome dynamics. These findings establish a molecular framework connecting tissue identity with thermal sensing and set out directions for the production of temperature-resilient crops.},

This finding has accelerated the identification and functional analyses of these orthologues involved in floral transition in flowering plant species.

The final number of flowering nodes was independent of the growth patterns, but varied according to the nitrogen starvation period: early and prolonged nitrogen starvation prematurely stopped the progression of flowering.

	abstract = {Plants adapt to the prevailing photoperiod by adjusting growth and ﬂowering to the availability of energy. To understand the molecular changes involved in adaptation to a long-day condition we comprehensively proﬁled leaf six at the end of the day and the end of the night at four developmental stages on Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown in a 16 h photoperiod, and compared the proﬁles to those from leaf 6 of plants grown in a 8 h photoperiod. When Arabidopsis is grown in a long-day photoperiod individual leaf growth is accelerated but whole plant leaf area is decreased because total number of rosette leaves is restricted by the rapid transition to ﬂowering. Carbohydrate measurements in long- and short-day photoperiods revealed that a long photoperiod decreases the extent of diurnal turnover of carbon reserves at all leaf stages. At the transcript level we found that the long-day condition has signiﬁcantly reduced diurnal transcript level changes than in short-day condition, and that some transcripts shift their diurnal expression pattern. Functional categorisation of the transcripts with signiﬁcantly different levels in short and long day conditions revealed photoperiod-dependent differences in RNA processing and light and hormone signalling, increased abundance of transcripts for biotic stress response and ﬂavonoid metabolism in long photoperiods, and for photosynthesis and sugar transport in short photoperiods. Furthermore, we found transcript level changes consistent with an early release of ﬂowering repression in the long-day condition. Differences in protein levels between long and short photoperiods mainly reﬂect an adjustment to the faster growth in long photoperiods. In summary, the observed differences in the molecular proﬁles of leaf six grown in long- and short-day photoperiods reveal changes in the regulation of metabolism that allow plants to adjust their metabolism to the available light. The data also suggest that energy management is in the two photoperiods fundamentally different as a consequence of photoperiod-dependent energy constraints.},

In the last 30 years, this view has been spectacularly overturned, with a wealth of evidence showing that plants actively detect and respond to their neighbours. Moreover, there is evidence that these responses depend on the identity of the neighbour, and that plants may cooperate with their kin, displaying social behaviour as complex as that observed in animals. These plant–plant interactions play a vital role in shaping natural ecosystems, and are also very important in determining agricultural productivity. However, in terms of mechanistic understanding, we have only just begun to scratch the surface, and many aspects of plant–plant interactions remain poorly understood. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the field of plant–plant interactions, covering the communal interactions of plants with their neighbours as well as the social behaviour of plants towards their kin, and the consequences of these interactions. We particularly focus on the mechanisms that underpin neighbour detection and response, highlighting both progress and gaps in our understanding of these fascinating but previously overlooked interactions.},

Some mutants exhibited their mutant phenotypes speci®cally in foliage leaves. The phenotypes associated with the foliage-leaf-speci®c mutations were also found to be induced ectopically in cotyledons in the presence of the lec1 mutation. Moreover, the features of an emf1 lec1 double mutant showed that cotyledons can be partially converted into carpelloids. When heteroblastic traits were examined in foliage leaves in the presence of certain mutations or natural deviations by histochemical analysis of the expression of the tissuespeci®c marker gene, it was found that ectopic expression of the developmental program for the ®rst foliage leaves in lec1 cotyledons seemed to aect the heteroblastic features of the ®rst set of foliage leaves, while foliage leaves beyond the third position appeared normal. Similarly, in wild-type plants, discrepancies in heteroblastic features, relative to standard features, of foliage leaves at early positions seemed to be eliminated in foliage leaves at later positions. These results suggest that heteroblasty in foliage leaves might be aected in part by the heteroblastic stage of the preceding foliage leaves but is ®nally controlled autonomously at each leaf position.},

Day-length sensing involves an interaction between the relative length of day and night, and endogenous rhythms that are controlled by the plant circadian clock1. Thus, plants with defects in circadian regulation cannot properly regulate the timing of the floral transition2. Here we describe the gene EARLY FLOWERING 4 (ELF4), which is involved in photoperiod perception and circadian regulation. ELF4 promotes clock accuracy and is required for sustained rhythms in the absence of daily light/dark cycles. elf4 mutants show attenuated expression of CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1), a gene that is thought to function as a central oscillator component3,4. In addition, elf4 plants transiently show output rhythms with highly variable period lengths before becoming arrhythmic. Mutations in elf4 result in early flowering in non-inductive photoperiods, which is probably caused by elevated amounts of CONSTANS (CO), a gene that promotes floral induction5.},

	abstract = {The circadian clock is an endogenous timekeeper system that generates biological rhythms of approximately 24 h in most organisms. EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) and ELF4 were initially identified as negative regulators of flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana. They were then found to play crucial roles in the circadian clock by integrating environmental light and ambient temperature signals and transmitting them to the central oscillator, thereby regulating various downstream cellular and physiological processes. At dusk, ELF3 acts as a scaffold, interacting with ELF4 and the transcription factor LUX ARRHYTHMO (PHYTOCLOCK1) to form an EVENING COMPLEX (EC). This complex represses the transcription of multiple circadian clock-related genes, thus inhib­ iting hypocotyl elongation and flowering. Subsequent studies have expanded knowledge about the regulatory roles of the EC in thermomorphogenesis and shade responses. In addition, ELF3 and ELF4 also form multiple complexes with other proteins including chromatin remodeling factors, histone deacetylase, and transcription factors, thus enabling the transcriptional repression of diverse targets. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of ELF3 and ELF4 in plants and discuss directions for future research on ELF3 and ELF4.},

To survive and thrive in changing conditions, plants have evolved adaptive responses that tightly regulate developmental processes such as hypocotyl elongation and ﬂowering time in response to environmental temperature changes. Increases in temperature, coupled with increasing ﬂuctuations in local climate and weather, severely affect our agricultural systems; therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which plants perceive and respond to temperature is critical for agricultural sustainability. In this review, we summarize recent ﬁndings on the molecular mechanisms of ambient temperature perception as well as possible temperature sensing components in plants. Based on recent publications, we highlight several temperature response mechanisms, including the deposition and eviction of histone variants, DNA methylation, alternative splicing, protein degradation, and protein localization. We discuss roles of each proposed temperature-sensing mechanism that affects plant development, with an emphasis on ﬂowering time. Studies of plant ambient temperature responses are advancing rapidly, and this review provides insights for future research aimed at understanding the mechanisms of temperature perception and responses in plants.},

Here, we demonstrate that the phytochrome B (phyB) photoreceptor participates in temperature perception through its temperature-dependent reversion from the active Pfr state to the inactive Pr state. Increased rates of thermal reversion upon exposing Arabidopsis seedlings to warm environments reduce both the abundance of the biologically active Pfr-Pfr dimer pool of phyB and the size of the associated nuclear bodies, even in daylight. Mathematical analysis of stem growth for seedlings expressing wild-type phyB or thermally stable variants under various combinations of light and temperature revealed that phyB is physiologically responsive to both signals. We therefore propose that in addition to its photoreceptor functions, phyB is a temperature sensor in plants.},

However, PIF4 activity is tightly controlled by its interacting proteins. Until now, twenty-ﬁve individual proteins have been reported to physically interact with PIF4. These PIF4-interacting proteins act together with PIF4 and form a unique nexus for plant adaption to light or temperature change. In this review, we will discuss the different categories of PIF4-interacting proteins, including photoreceptors, circadian clock regulators, hormone signaling components, and transcription factors. These distinct PIF4-interacting proteins either integrate light and/or temperature cues with endogenous hormone signaling, or control PIF4 abundances and transcriptional activities. Taken together, PIF4 and PIF4-interacting proteins play major roles for exogenous and endogenous signal integrations, and therefore establish a robust network for plants to cope with their surrounding environmental alterations.},

Nitrate can also act as a signaling molecule that directs genome-wide gene expression changes with an impact on plant metabolism, physiology, growth and development. Nitrate and phytohormone signaling pathways crosstalk to modulate growth and developmental programs in a multifactorial manner. Nitrate-signaling controls plant growth and development using molecular mechanisms that involve phytohormone-signaling pathways. In contrast, many phytohormones modulate or impact nitrate signaling in interconnected pathways. In this review, we explore recent progress in our understanding of well-documented connections between nitrate and phytohormones such as auxin, cytokinin and abscisic acid. We also discuss recent studies connecting nitrate to other phytohormones such as ethylene, salicylic acid, gibberellins and brassinosteroids. While many molecular details remain to be elucidated, a number of core signaling components at the intersection between nitrate and the major hormonal pathways have been described. We focus on established interactions of nitrate and different hormonal pathways to bring about cellular, growth and developmental processes in Arabidopsis thaliana.},

Here, we present data showing that COP1 acts with ELF3 to mediate day length signaling from CRY2 to GI within the photoperiod flowering pathway. We found that COP1 and ELF3 interact in vivo and show that ELF3 allows COP1 to interact with GI in vivo, leading to GI degradation in planta. Accordingly, mutation of COP1 or ELF3 disturbs the pattern of GI cyclic accumulation. We propose a model in which ELF3 acts as a substrate adaptor, enabling COP1 to modulate light input signal to the circadian clock through targeted destabilization of GI.},

Daily rhythms in the plant circadian system are generated by multiple interlocked transcriptional/translational loops and also by spatial regulations such as nuclear translocation. GIGANTEA (GI), one of the key clock components in Arabidopsis, makes distinctive nuclear bodies like other nuclear-localized circadian regulators. However, little is known about the dynamics or roles of GI subnuclear localization. Here, we characterize GI subnuclear compartmentalization and identify unexpected dynamic changes under diurnal conditions. We further identify EARLY FLOWERING 4 (ELF4) as a regulator of GI nuclear distribution through a physical interaction. ELF4 sequesters GI from the nucleoplasm, where GI binds the promoter of CONSTANS (CO), to discrete nuclear bodies. We suggest that the subnuclear compartmentalization of GI by ELF4 contributes to the regulation of photoperiodic flowering.},

Similarly, EARLY FLOWERING 4 (ELF4), another clock regulator, also contributes to these processes. However, little is known about either the genetic or molecular interactions between GI and ELF4 in Arabidopsis. In this study, we investigated the genetic interactions between GI and ELF4 in the regulation of circadian clock-controlled outputs. Our mutant analysis shows that GI is epistatic to ELF4 in flowering time determination, while ELF4 is epistatic to GI in hypocotyl growth regulation. Moreover, GI and ELF4 have a synergistic or additive effect on endogenous clock regulation. Gene expression profiling of gi, elf4, and gi elf4 mutants further established that GI and ELF4 have differentially dominant influences on circadian physiological outputs at dusk and dawn, respectively. This phasing of GI and ELF4 influences provides a potential means to achieve diversity in the regulation of circadian physiological outputs, including flowering time and hypocotyl growth.},

The circadian clock provides a mechanism for plants to anticipate events such as sunrise and adjust their transcriptional programmes. However, the underlying mechanisms by which plants coordinate environmental signals with endogenous pathways are not fully understood. Using RNA-sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing experiments, we show that the evening complex (EC) of the circadian clock plays a major role in directly coordinating the expression of hundreds of key regulators of photosynthesis, the circadian clock, phytohormone signalling, growth and response to the environment. We find that the ability of the EC to bind targets genome-wide depends on temperature. In addition, co-occurrence of phytochrome B (phyB) at multiple sites where the EC is bound provides a mechanism for integrating environmental information. Hence, our results show that the EC plays a central role in coordinating endogenous and environmental signals in Arabidopsis.},

	abstract = {Photoperiodic plants perceive changes in day length as seasonal cues to orchestrate their vegetative and reproductive growth. Although it is known that the floral transition of photoperiod-sensitive plants is tightly controlled by day length, how photoperiod affects their post-flowering development remains to be clearly defined, as do the underlying mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that photoperiod plays a prominent role in seed development. We found that long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) plants produce larger seeds under LD and SD conditions, respectively; however, seed size remains unchanged when CONSTANS (CO), the central regulatory gene of the photoperiodic response pathway, is mutated in Arabidopsis and soybean. We further found that CO directly represses the transcription of AP2 (a known regulatory gene of seed development) under LD conditions in Arabidopsis and SD conditions in soybean, thereby controlling seed size in a photoperiod-dependent manner, and that these effects are exerted through regulation of the proliferation of seed coat epidermal cells. Collectively, our findings reveal that a crucial regulatory cascade involving CO-AP2 modulates photoperiod-mediated seed development in plants and provide new insights into how plants with different photoperiod response types perceive seasonal changes that enable them to optimize their reproductive growth.},

Plants have to interpret temperature fluctuations, over hourly to monthly timescales, to align their growth and development with the seasons. Much is known about how plants respond to acute thermal stresses3,4, but the mechanisms that integrate long-term temperature exposure remain unknown. The slow, winter-long upregulation of VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3)5–7, a PHD protein that functions with Polycomb repressive complex 2 to epigenetically silence FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) during vernalization, is central to plants interpreting winter progression5,6,8–11. Here, by a forward genetic screen, we identify two dominant mutations of the transcription factor NTL8 that constitutively activate VIN3 expression and alter the slow VIN3 cold induction profile. In the wild type, the NTL8 protein accumulates slowly in the cold, and directly upregulates VIN3 transcription. Through combining computational simulation and experimental validation, we show that a major contributor to this slow accumulation is reduced NTL8 dilution due to slow growth at low temperatures. Temperature-dependent growth is thus exploited through protein dilution to provide the long-term thermosensory information for VIN3 upregulation. Indirect mechanisms involving temperature-dependent growth, in addition to direct thermosensing, may be widely relevant in long-term biological sensing of naturally fluctuating temperatures.},

	abstract = {Warm temperature promotes flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana and this response involves multiple signalling pathways. To understand the temporal dynamics of temperature perception, tests were carried out to determine if there was a daily window of enhanced sensitivity to warm temperature (28 °C). Warm temperature applied during daytime, night-time, or continuously elicited earlier flowering, but the effects of each treatment were unequal. Plants exposed to warm night (WN) conditions flowered nearly as early as those in constant warm (CW) conditions, while treatment with warm days (WD) caused later flowering than either WN or CW. Flowering in each condition relied to varying degrees on the activity of 
CO
, 
FT
, 
PIF4
, and 
PIF5
, as well as the action of unknown genes. The combination of signalling pathways involved in flowering depended on the time of the temperature cue. WN treatments caused a significant advance in the rhythmic expression waveform of CO, which correlated with pronounced up-regulation of FT expression, while WD caused limited changes in CO expression and no stimulation of FT expression. WN- and WD-induced flowering was partially CO independent and, unexpectedly, dependent on 
PIF4
and 
PIF5
. pif4-2, pif5-3, and pif4-2 pif5-3 mutants had delayed flowering under all three warm conditions. The double mutant was also late flowering in control conditions. In addition, WN conditions alone imposed selective changes to PIF4 and PIF5 expression. Thus, the PIF4 and PIF5 transcription factors promote flowering by at least two means: inducing FT expression in WN and acting outside of FT by an unknown mechanism in WD., The timing of warm temperature cues dictates the magnitude of the early flowering response in Arabidopsis thaliana and the contribution of CO, FT, PIF4, and PIF5 to promotion of flowering.},

An important integrator of these inputs is the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene, which encodes a small, possibly mobile protein. A primary response to floral induction is the activation of FT RNA expression in leaves. Because flowers form at a distant site, the shoot apex, these data suggest that FT primarily controls the timing of flowering. Integration of temporal and spatial information is mediated in part by the bZIP transcription factor FD, which is already expressed at the shoot apex before floral induction. A complex of FT and FD proteins in turn can activate floral identity genes such as APETALA1 (AP1).},

	abstract = {Common histidine-to-aspartate (His→Asp) phosphorelay is a paradigm of signal transduction in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes for the propagation of certain environmental stimuli, in which histidine (His)-kinases play central roles as sensors for environmental signals. For the higher plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, it was recently suggested that the His-kinase (AHK4 / CRE1 / WOL) is a sensor for cytokinins, which are a class of plant hormones important for the regulation of cell division and differentiation. Interestingly, AHK4 is capable of functioning as a cytokinin sensor in the eubacterium, Escherichia coli (Suzuki et al. 2001, Plant Cell Physiol. 42: 107). Here we further show that AHK4 is a primary receptor that directly binds a variety of natural and synthetic cytokinins (e.g. not only N6-substituted aminopurines such as isopentenyl-adenine, trans-zeatin, benzyl-adenine, but also diphenylurea derivatives such as thidiazuron), in a highly specific manner (Kd = 4.55±0.48×10–9 M). AHK4 has a presumed extracellular domain, within which a single amino acid substitution (Thr-301 to Ile) was shown to result in loss of its ability to bind cytokinins. This particular mutation corresponds to the previously reported wol allele (wooden leg) that causes a striking phenotype defective in vascular morphogenesis. Collectively, evidence is presented that AHK4 and its homologues (AHK3 and possibly AHK2) are receptor kinases that can transduce cytokinin signals across the plasma membrane of A. thaliana.},

Recent chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) studies have identified targets of type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORs (ARRs) and integrated these into the cytokinin-activated transcriptional network. Primary targets of the type-B ARRs are enriched for genes involved in hormonal regulation, emphasizing the extensive crosstalk that can occur between cytokinin, auxin, abscisic acid, brassinosteroids, gibberellic acid, ethylene, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid. Examination of hormone-related targets reveals multiple regulatory points including biosynthesis, degradation/inactivation, transport, and signal transduction.

	abstract = {Arabidopsis thaliana has 11 members belonging to the typical type-B ARR (authentic response regulator) family. Among them, seven highly homologous members appear also to be conserved in rice (Oryza sativa), but others are not. It was suggested that these seven ARRs are commonly implicated as DNA-binding transcription factors in the phosphorelay-mediated cytokinin signal transduction network in higher plants. To gain an insight into the functions of the cytokinin-associated type-B ARRs, we previously investigated an arr1 arr10 arr12 triple mutant and reported that it exhibited stunted growth and abnormality in vascular development. Based on this fact, here we attempted to characterize the mutant intensively with reference to cytokinin-associated phenotypes through the life cycle. We showed that the observed cytokinin-associated phenotypes of arr1 arr10 arr12 were very severe and highly analogous to those observed for certain ahk2 ahk3 ahk4/cre1 triple mutants, which have virtually no cytokinin receptor to propagate the phosphorelay signal transduction network. Among the seven ARR members belonging to the cytokinin-associated type-B ARR subfamily, it was thus suggested that ARR1, ARR10 and ARR12 together play essential (or general) roles in cytokinin signal transduction. It is therefore conceivable that the other type-B ARRs (ARR2, ARR11, ARR14 and ARR18) might play more specific roles spatially and temporally in plants.},

Molecular-genetic studies in Arabidopsis thaliana have focused on daily light duration, or photoperiod, and transient exposure to winter-like temperatures, or vernalization1. Yet ambient growth temperature, which is strongly affected by current changes in global climate2, has been largely ignored. Here, we show that genes of the autonomous pathway, previously thought only to act independently of the environment as regulators of the floral repressor FLC (ref. 1), are centrally involved in mediating the effects of ambient temperature. In contrast to wild-type plants and those mutant in other pathways, autonomous-pathway mutants flower at the same time regardless of ambient temperature. In contrast, the exaggerated temperature response of cryptochrome-2 mutants is caused by temperature-dependent redundancy with the phytochrome A photoreceptor. As with vernalization and photoperiod, ambient temperature ultimately affects expression of the floral pathway integrator FT.},

	abstract = {Warm temperature promotes flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana and this response involves multiple signalling pathways. To understand the temporal dynamics of temperature perception, tests were carried out to determine if there was a daily window of enhanced sensitivity to warm temperature (28 °C). Warm temperature applied during daytime, night-time, or continuously elicited earlier flowering, but the effects of each treatment were unequal. Plants exposed to warm night (WN) conditions flowered nearly as early as those in constant warm (CW) conditions, while treatment with warm days (WD) caused later flowering than either WN or CW. Flowering in each condition relied to varying degrees on the activity of CO , FT , PIF4 , and PIF5 , as well as the action of unknown genes. The combination of signalling pathways involved in flowering depended on the time of the temperature cue. WN treatments caused a significant advance in the rhythmic expression waveform of CO, which correlated with pronounced up-regulation of FT expression, while WD caused limited changes in CO expression and no stimulation of FT expression. WN- and WD-induced flowering was partially CO independent and, unexpectedly, dependent on PIF4 and PIF5 . pif4-2, pif5-3, and pif4-2 pif5-3 mutants had delayed flowering under all three warm conditions. The double mutant was also late flowering in control conditions. In addition, WN conditions alone imposed selective changes to PIF4 and PIF5 expression. Thus, the PIF4 and PIF5 transcription factors promote flowering by at least two means: inducing FT expression in WN and acting outside of FT by an unknown mechanism in WD.},

              Shoot-branching patterns affect key aspects of plant life and are important targets for crop breeding. However, we are still ignorant of the genetic mechanisms controlling locally an important decision during branch development: whether the axillary bud grows out to give a lateral shoot or remains dormant. Here we show that the TEOSINTE BRANCHED1, CYCLOIDEA, PCF (TCP) transcriptional regulator BRANCHED1 (BRC1), which acts inside axillary buds, binds and activates three genes encoding Homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-ZIP) transcription factors. These factors, together with BRC1, trigger a cascade leading to local abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation and response, essential for bud dormancy under light-limiting conditions.

Here we show that, inside the buds, the TEOSINTE BRANCHED1, CYCLOIDEA, PCF (TCP) transcription factor BRANCHED1 (BRC1) binds to and positively regulates the transcription of three related Homeodomain leucine zipper protein (HD-ZIP)-encoding genes:

Since the discovery of the hormonal function of SLs in 2008, there has been much progress in the SL research field. In particular, a number of breakthroughs have been achieved in our understanding of SL biosynthesis, transport and perception. The discovery of the hormonal function of SL was quite valuable not only as the identification of a new class of plant hormones, but also as the discovery of the long-sought-after SL biosynthetic and response mutants. These mutants in several plant species provided us the genetic resources to address fundamental questions regarding SL biosynthesis and perception. Such mutants were further characterized later, and biochemical analyses of these genetically identified factors have uncovered the outline of SL biosynthesis and perception so far. Moreover, new genes involved in SL transport have been discovered through reverse genetic analyses. In this review, we summarize recent advances in SL research with a focus on biosynthesis, transport and perception.},

	abstract = {Fertility and flower development are both controlled in part by jasmonates, fatty acid-derived mediators produced via the activity of 13-lipoxygenases (13-LOXs). The Arabidopsis thalianaColumbia-0 reference genome is predicted to encode four of these enzymes and it is already known that one of these, LOX2, is dispensable for fertility. In this study, the roles of the other three 13-LOXs (LOX3, LOX4 and LOX6) were investigated in single and double mutants. Four independent lox3 lox4 double mutants assembled with different mutated lox3 and lox4 alleles had fully penetrant floral phenotypes, displaying abnormal anther maturation and defective dehiscence. The plants were no longer self-fertile and pollen was not viable. Fertility in the double mutant was restored genetically by complementation with either the LOX3 or the LOX4 cDNAs and biochemically with exogenous jasmonic acid. Furthermore, deficiency in LOX3 and LOX4 causes developmental dysfunctions, compared to wild type; lox3 lox4 double mutants are taller and develop more inflorescence shoots and flowers. Further analysis revealed that developmental arrest in the lox3 lox4 inflorescence occurs with the production of an abnormal carpelloid flower. This distinguishes lox3 lox4 mutants from the wild type where developmentally typical flower buds are the terminal inflorescence structures observed in both the laboratory and in nature. Our studies of lox3 lox4 as well as other jasmonic acid biosynthesis and perception mutants show that this plant hormone is not only required for male fertility but also involved in global proliferative arrest.},

In this study, we aimed to identify candidate genes associated with these composite traits in Arabidopsis thaliana using a field experiment. Genome-wide association (GWA) mapping was performed on BT, INT and FT based on a sample of 179 worldwide natural accessions genotyped for 216,509 SNPs. The high resolution conferred by GWA mapping indicates that FT is an integrative trait at the genetic level, with distinct genetics for BT and INT. BT is shaped largely by genes involved in the circadian clock whereas INT is shaped by genes involved in both the hormone pathways and cold acclimation. Finally, the florigen TSF appears to be the main integrator of environmental and internal signals in ecologically realistic conditions. Based on FT scored in a previous field experiment, we also studied the genetics underlying reaction norms across two years. Only four genes were common to both years, emphasizing the need to repeat field experiments. The gene regulation model appeared as the main genetic model for genotype × year interactions.},

However, little information is known about how genetic architecture changes among environments. We used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Boechera stricta (Graham) Al-Shehbaz, a relative of Arabidopsis, to examine flowering variation among environments and associations with climate conditions in home environments. Also, we used molecular population genetics to search for evidence of historical natural selection. GWAS found 47 significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that influence flowering time in one or more environments, control plastic changes in phenology between experiments, or show associations with climate in sites of origin. Genetic architecture of flowering varied substantially among environments. We found that some pairs of QTLs showed similar patterns of pleiotropy across environments. A large-effect QTL showed molecular signatures of adaptive evolution and is associated with climate in home environments. The derived allele at this locus causes later flowering and predominates in sites with greater water availability. This work shows that GWAS of climate associations and ecologically important traits across diverse environments can be combined with molecular signatures of natural selection to elucidate ecological genetics of adaptive evolution.},

F-box proteins are encoded by a large gene family. Our database search revealed that at least 568 F-box protein genes are present in the Arabidopsisthaliana (Arabidopsis) genome. Domain search analysis using SMART and Pfam-A databases revealed that 67 of the F-box proteins contained Kelch repeats and 29 contained leucine-rich repeats (LRRs). Interestingly only two F-box proteins contained WD40 repeats that are found in many F-box proteins of other organisms. Kelch repeats, LRRs and WD40 repeats are implicated in protein–protein interactions. This analysis also resulted in the finding of several unique functional domains; however, 448 of the F-box proteins did not contain any known domains. Therefore, these proteins were used to search the Pfam-B database to find novel domains, and three putative ones were found. These domain search analyses led us to classify the Arabidopsis F-box proteins into at least 19 groups based on their domain structures. Macro array analysis showed that several F-box protein genes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner.},

Thus, it is exposed to a wide range of environmental factors and has been subject to natural selection under distinct conditions. Full genome sequencing data for more than 1000 different natural inbred lines are available, and this has encouraged the distributed generation of many types of phenotypic data. To leverage these data for meta analyses, AraPheno (https://arapheno.1001genomes.org) provide a central repository of population-scale phenotypes for A. thaliana inbred lines.

	abstract = {Seed plants vary tremendously in size and morphology; however, variation and covariation in plant traits may be governed, at least in part, by universal biophysical laws and biological constants. Metabolic scaling theory (MST) posits that whole-organismal metabolism and growth rate are under stabilizing selection that minimizes the scaling of hydrodynamic resistance and maximizes the scaling of resource uptake. This constrains variation in physiological traits and in the rate of biomass accumulation, so that they can be expressed as mathematical functions of plant size with near-constant allometric scaling exponents across species. However, the observed variation in scaling exponents calls into question the evolutionary drivers and the universality of allometric equations. We have measured growth scaling and fitness traits of 451 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions with sequenced genomes. Variation among accessions around the scaling exponent predicted by MST was correlated with relative growth rate, seed production, and stress resistance. Genomic analyses indicate that growth allometry is affected by many genes associated with local climate and abiotic stress response. The gene with the strongest effect, PUB4, has molecular signatures of balancing selection, suggesting that intraspecific variation in growth scaling is maintained by opposing selection on the trade-off between seed production and abiotic stress resistance. Our findings suggest that variation in allometry contributes to local adaptation to contrasting environments. Our results help reconcile past debates on the origin of allometric scaling in biology and begin to link adaptive variation in allometric scaling to specific genes.},

Allele competition experiments suggest that l28 is a dominant-negative allele of the APETALA2 (AP2) gene, which previously has been implicated in floral patterning and seed development. Expression of both WUSCHEL (WUS) and CLAVATA3 (CLV3) genes, which regulate stem cell maintenance in the wild type, were disrupted in l28 shoot apices from early stages on. Unlike in floral patterning, AP2 mRNA is active in the center of the shoot meristem and acts via a mechanism independent of AGAMOUS, which is a repressor of WUS and stem cell maintenance in the floral meristem. Genetic analysis shows that termination of the primary shoot meristem in l28 mutants requires an active CLV signaling pathway, indicating that AP2 functions in stem cell maintenance by modifying the WUS-CLV3 feedback loop.},

We performed a genetic screen with ag-10 plants, which exhibit a weak floral determinacy defect, and isolated a mutant with a strong floral determinacy defect. This mutant was found to harbor another mutation in AG and was named ag-11. We performed a genetic screen in the ag-11 background to isolate mutations that suppress the floral determinacy defect. Two suppressor mutants were found to harbor mutations in AP2. While AG is known to shut down the expression of the stem cell maintenance gene WUSCHEL (WUS) to terminate floral stem cell fate, AP2 promotes the expression of WUS. AP2 does not repress the transcription of AG in the inner two whorls, but instead counteracts AG activity.},

Over the past three decades, extensive genetic and molecular analyses have led to the identification of a large number of key floral regulators and to detailed insights into how they control flower morphogenesis. In recent years, genome-wide approaches have been applied to obtaining a global view of the gene regulatory networks underlying flower formation. Furthermore, mathematical models have been developed that can simulate certain aspects of this process and drive further experimentation. Here, we review some of the main findings made in the field of Arabidopsis thaliana flower development, with an emphasis on recent advances. In particular, we discuss the activities of the floral organ identity factors, which are pivotal for the specification of the different types of floral organs, and explore the experimental avenues that may elucidate the molecular mechanisms and gene expression programs through which these master regulators of flower development act.

	abstract = {Agricultural productivity is limited by the removal of sap, alterations in source–sink patterns, and viral diseases vectored by aphids, which are phloem-feeding pests. Here we show that TREHALOSE PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE11 (TPS11) gene-dependent trehalose metabolism regulates Arabidopsis thaliana defense against Myzus persicae (Sülzer), commonly known as the green peach aphid (GPA). GPA infestation of Arabidopsis resulted in a transient increase in trehalose and expression of the TPS11 gene, which encodes a trehalose-6-phosphate synthase/phosphatase. Knockout of TPS11 function abolished trehalose increases in GPA-infested leaves of the tps11 mutant plant and attenuated defense against GPA. Trehalose application restored resistance in the tps11 mutant, confirming that the lack of trehalose accumulation is associated with the inability of the tps11 mutant to control GPA infestation. Resistance against GPA was also higher in the trehalose hyper-accumulating tre1 mutant and in bacterial otsB gene-expressing plants, further supporting the conclusion that trehalose plays a role in Arabidopsis defense against GPA. Evidence presented here indicates that TPS11-dependent trehalose regulates expression of the PHYTOALEXIN DEFICIENT4 gene, which is a key modulator of defenses against GPA. TPS11 also promotes the re-allocation of carbon into starch at the expense of sucrose, the primary plant-derived carbon and energy source for the insect. Our results provide a framework for the signaling function of TPS11-dependent trehalose in plant stress responses, and also reveal an important contribution of starch in controlling the severity of aphid infestation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Heteroblasty refers to a phenomenon that a plant produces morphologically or functionally different lateral organs in an age-dependent manner. In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the production of trichomes (epidermal leaf hairs) on the abaxial (lower) side of leaves is a heteroblastic mark for the juvenile-to-adult transition. Here, we show that the heteroblastic development of abaxial trichomes is regulated by a spatiotemporally regulated complex comprising the leaf abaxial fate determinant (KAN1) and the developmental timer (miR172-targeted AP2-like proteins). We provide evidence that a short-distance chromatin loop brings the downstream enhancer element into close association with the promoter elements of GL1, which encodes a MYB transcription factor essential for trichome initiation. During juvenile phase, the KAN1-AP2 repressive complex binds to the downstream sequence of GL1 and represses its expression through chromatin looping. As plants age, the gradual reduction in AP2-like protein levels leads to decreased amount of the KAN1-AP2 complex, thereby licensing GL1 expression and the abaxial trichome initiation. Our results thus reveal a novel molecular mechanism by which a heteroblastic trait is governed by integrating age and leaf polarity cue in plants.},

            A key problem in biology is whether the same processes underlie morphological variation between and within species. Here, we show that the causes of leaf shape diversity at these two evolutionary scales can be divergent. Some species have simple leaves, whereas others bear complex leaves comprising leaflets. Previous work indicated that these interspecific differences result mostly from variation in local tissue growth and patterning. Now we find that a different process, age-dependent shape progression, underlies within-species variation in complex leaf morphology. Specifically, in plants with accelerated aging and early flowering, leaves progress to adult shapes with more leaflets, faster than their slower-aging counterparts. This mechanism coordinates leaf development with reproductive timing and may influence resource allocation to seeds.

              A key problem in biology is whether the same processes underlie morphological variation between and within species. Here, by using plant leaves as an example, we show that the causes of diversity at these two evolutionary scales can be divergent. Some species like the model plant
              Arabidopsis thaliana
              have simple leaves, whereas others like the
              A. thaliana

              Cardamine hirsuta
              bear complex leaves comprising leaflets. Previous work has shown that these interspecific differences result mostly from variation in local tissue growth and patterning. Now, by cloning and characterizing a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for
              C. hirsuta
              leaf shape, we find that a different process, age-dependent progression of leaf form, underlies variation in this trait within species. This QTL effect is caused by
              cis
              -regulatory variation in the floral repressor
              ChFLC
              , such that genotypes with low-expressing
              ChFLC
              alleles show both early flowering and accelerated age-dependent changes in leaf form, including faster leaflet production. We provide evidence that this mechanism coordinates leaf development with reproductive timing and may help to optimize resource allocation to the next generation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Optimal partitioning theory (OPT) predicts plants will allocate biomass to organs where resources are limiting. Studies of OPT focus on root, stem and leaf mass ratios where roots and stems are often further sub-divided into organs such as fine roots/tap roots or branches/main stem. Leaves, however, are rarely sub-divided into different organs. Heteroblastic species develop juvenile and adult foliage and provide an opportunity of sub-dividing leaf mass ratio into distinct organs. Acacia implexa (Mimosaceae) is a heteroblastic species that develops compound (juvenile), transitional and phyllode (adult) leaves that differ dramatically in form and function. The aims of the present study were to grow A. implexa to examine patterns of plastic development of whole-plant and leaf traits under the OPT framework.
METHODS: Plants were grown in a glasshouse under contrasting nutrient, light and water environments in a full factorial design. Allocation to whole-plant and leaf-level traits was measured and analysed with multivariate statistics.
KEY RESULTS: Whole-plant traits strongly followed patterns predicted by OPT. Leaf-level traits showed a more complex pattern in response to experimental treatments. Compound leaves on low nutrient plants had significantly lower specific leaf area (SLA) and were retained for longer as quantified by a significantly greater compound leaf mass ratio after 120 d. There was no significant difference in SLA of compound leaves in the light treatment, yet transitional SLA was significantly higher under the low light treatment. The timing of heteroblastic shift from compound to transitional leaves was significantly delayed only in the low light treatment. Therefore, plants in the light treatment responded at the whole-plant level by adjusting allocation to productive compound leaves and at the leaf-level by adjusting SLA. There were no significant SLA differences in the water treatment despite strong trends at the whole-plant level.
CONCLUSION: Explicitly sub-dividing leaves into different types provided greater insights into OPT.},

	abstract = {The existence of genetic variation in offspring size in plants and animals is puzzling because offspring size is often strongly associated with fitness and expected to be under stabilizing selection. An explanation for variation in seed size is conflict between parents and between parents and offspring. However, for this hypothesis to be true, it must be shown that the offspring genotype can affect its own size. The existence of paternal effects would support this hypothesis, but these have rarely been shown. Using a diallel cross among four natural accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana we show that maternal, paternal and positional effects jointly influence seed size, number and the frequency of seed abortion. We found that seed abortion (\%) depends on the combination of maternal and paternal genotypes, suggesting the existence of mate choice or epistatic incompatibility among accessions of A. thaliana. In addition, since paternal genotype explains approximately 10 per cent of the variation in seed size, we propose that A. thaliana's offspring must influence the amount of resources allocated to themselves. Identification of paternal effects in Arabidopsis should facilitate dissection of the genetic mechanisms involved in paternal effects.},

	abstract = {We tested the hypotheses that increased soil resource availability selects for larger seeded plants by: (1) increasing community seed density and seedling competition, (2) increasing light competition, which favours larger seeded species if their additional seed resources are allocated to shoots. We also tested the hypothesis that plants respond to increased nutrient availability by producing larger seeds. In a controlled environment experiment, we grew monocultures of five species of co-occurring annual plant species at two N addition rates and measured seed size and the number of seeds produced. In a second experiment, we sowed seed of the five species together, manipulated nitrogen (N) addition rate and community seed density and measured species performance. In the first experiment, elevated N addition increased seed size, but only in larger seeded species. In the second experiment, high N addition increased community seed production. However, contrary to our hypothesis small seeded species were selected under high seed density, possibly because they germinated and grew more rapidly thus enabling them to pre-empt limiting resources. Larger seeded species were favoured by high N addition, as hypothesised. However, our data suggest that this was due to their seed reserves boosting survival below the denser canopies of fertile conditions rather than via competitive advantages. Our results point to a largely overlooked role of recruitment in determining community response to fertilisation. Although our results may not generalise to all plant communities they suggest that seed traits play a role in community response to both the direct effect of N addition and the stimulation of seed density caused by increased productivity. These results are also consistent with the view that the advantage of large seed size is not a competitive one, but greater survival in the face of environmental hazards.
Zusammenfassung
Wir untersuchten die Hypothese, dass eine zunehmende Verfügbarkeit von Bodenressourcen zu einer Selektion von Pflanzen mit größeren Samen führt, indem: (1) die Samendichte und damit die Konkurrenz der Keimlinge in der Gemeinschaft erhöht wird, (2) die Konkurrenz um Licht größer wird, was Arten mit größeren Samen fördert, wenn ihre zusätzlichen Samenressourcen in die Schösslinge gehen. Wir untersuchten außerdem die Hypothese, dass Pflanzen auf eine erhöhte Nährstoffverfügbarkeit reagieren indem sie größere Samen produzieren. In einem Experiment unter kontrollierten Umweltbedingungen zogen wir Monokulturen von fünf gemeinsam vorkommenden, annuellen Pflanzenarten bei zwei N Zusatzraten und maßen die Samengröße und die Anzahl der produzierten Samen. In einem zweiten säten wir die Samen der fünf Arten gemeinsam und manipulierten die Stickstoff (N) Zusatzrate sowie die Samendichte der Gemeinschaft und maßen die Artenperformanz. In dem ersten Experiment erhöhte ein höherer N Zusatz die Samengröße, dies jedoch nur bei den Arten mit größeren Samen. Im zweiten Experiment erhöhter ein hoher N Zusatz die Samenproduktion der Gemeinschaft. Im Gegensatz zu unserer Hypothese wurden bei hoher Samendichte Arten mit kleinen Samen selektiert, möglicherweise weil sie schneller keimten und wuchsen und so in der Lage waren limitierende Ressourcen aufzubrauchen. Arten mit großen Samen wurden bei einem hohen N Zusatz gefördert, so wie wir vermuteten. Unsere Daten lassen jedoch vermuten, dass dies jedoch eher darauf zurückzuführen war, dass ihre Samenreserven ihr Überleben unter der dichteren Pflanzendecke bei fruchtbaren Bedingungen ermöglichte, als auf Konkurrenzvorteile. Unsere Ergebnisse weisen auf die weitgehend übersehene Rolle der Rekrutierung bei der Bestimmung der Reaktion einer Gemeinschaft auf Düngung hin. Auch wenn unsere Ergebnisse nicht für alle Pflanzengemeinschaften generalisiert werden können lassen sie jedoch vermuten, dass die Sameneigenschaften eine Rolle bei der Reaktion einer Gemeinschaft sowohl auf den direkten Effekt eines N Zusatzes als auch auf die Erhöhung der Samendichte, die durch eine erhöhte Produktion verursacht wird, spielen. Diese Ergebnisse stimmen ebenfalls mit der Ansicht überein, dass der Vorteil von großen Samen kein Konkurrenzvorteil ist, sondern ein besseres Überleben im Angesicht von ungünstigen Umweltbedingungen ermöglicht.},

	abstract = {Seed mass is correlated with a number of other plant traits, including dispersal mode, growth form and specific leaf area. Specific leaf area is the main determinant of potential relative growth rate and an indicator of the site quality to which a species is adapted. The relationships with dispersal mode and growth form have consistent form in five datasets from three continents, and each account for about 20-30 \% of variation in log seed mass. Thus, there is also very substantial variation within growth form and dispersal categories. Much, but not all, of the 20-30\% is associated with shifted family composition between growth forms or dispersal modes. Experiments have shown that seedlings of larger-seeded species are better able to survive hazards including deep shade, drought, physical damage and the presence of competing vegetation. If there is a common mechanism under these different hazards, it seemingly must be a ‘reserve effect’, whereby during deployment and early growth larger-seeded species hold a bigger percentage of seed reserves uncommitted to seedling structure and available to support respiration or repair damage. A reserve effect has not yet been demonstrated directly. It remains possible that different mechanisms operate under different hazards. Under a reserve effect, advantages of larger seed size should be temporary, and temporary advantage has indeed been observed with regard to seedling survival under dense shade. Although larger seed mass confers benefits on seedlings, larger seeds must necessarily be produced in smaller numbers per unit of resource allocated. Seed mass is presumed to have evolved as a compromise between these counterposed pressures. Yet there has proved to be surprisingly little difference in average seed mass between very different vegetation regions, at least in temperate climates. Rather, there is startlingly wide variation in seed mass among species growing interspersed with each other. Recent applications of game theory may be capable of accounting for this wide variation between coexisting species, but at present these models are driven by competition among seedling species (as opposed to between seedlings and adults). It remains unclear whether competition among seedlings is a decisive influence on species composition in most of the world’s vegetation types.},

In this Primer article, we summarize some of the key findings in the field and attempt to explain them in a simple model that reconciles the normal and pathological roles for senescence. We discuss how a primary role of cellular senescence is to contribute to normal development, cell plasticity and tissue repair, as a dynamic and tightly regulated cellular program.

In addition, 25 germinated seeds per tree were grown in a greenhouse to assess offspring seedling survival during a death trial, where watering was stopped. Signiﬁcant differences between trees in cone and seed morphological traits were observed. The age of the mother tree had a signiﬁcant effect on cone size, seed size, and seed weight, but there was no effect on seed germination capacity and seed viability.

	abstract = {Seed dormancy—the absence of seed germination under favorable germination conditions—is a plant trait that evolved to enhance seedling survival by avoiding germination under unsuitable environmental conditions. In Arabidopsis, dormancy levels are influenced by the seed coat composition, while the endosperm is essential to repress seed germination of dormant seeds upon their imbibition. Recent research has shown that the mother plant modulates its progeny seed dormancy in response to seasonal temperature changes by changing specific aspects of seed coat and endosperm development. This process involves genomic imprinting by means of epigenetic marks deposited in the seed progeny and regulators previously known to regulate flowering time. This review discusses and summarizes these discoveries and provides an update on our present understanding of the role of DOG1 and abscisic acid, two key contributors to dormancy.},

	abstract = {Background:  Improving abiotic stress tolerance in wheat requires large scale screening of yield components such as seed weight, seed number and single seed weight, all of which is very laborious, and a detailed analysis of seed morphology is time-consuming and visually often impossible. Computed tomography offers the opportunity for much faster and more accurate assessment of yield components.
Results:  An X-ray computed tomographic analysis was carried out on 203 very diverse wheat accessions which have been exposed to either drought or combined drought and heat stress. Results demonstrated that our computed tomography pipeline was capable of evaluating grain set with an accuracy of 95–99\%. Most accessions exposed to combined drought and heat stress developed smaller, shrivelled seeds with an increased seed surface. As expected, seed weight and seed number per ear as well as single seed size were significantly reduced under combined drought and heat compared to drought alone. Seed weight along the ear was significantly reduced at the top and bottom of the wheat spike.
Conclusions:  We were able to establish a pipeline with a higher throughput with scanning times of 7 min per ear and accuracy than previous pipelines predicting a set of agronomical important seed traits and to visualize even more complex traits such as seed deformations. The pipeline presented here could be scaled up to use for high throughput, high resolution phenotyping of tens of thousands of heads, greatly accelerating breeding efforts to improve abiotic stress tolerance.},

	abstract = {Life in unpredictably changing habitats is a great challenge, especially for sessile organisms like plants. Fruit and seed heteromorphism is one way to cope with such variable environmental conditions. It denotes the production of distinct types of fruits and seeds that often mediate distinct life-history strategies in terms of dispersal, germination and seedling establishment. But although the phenomenon can be found in numerous species and apparently evolved several times independently, its developmental time course or molecular regulation remains largely unknown. Here, we studied fruit development in Aethionema arabicum, a dimorphic member of the Brassicaceae family. We characterized fruit morph differentiation by comparatively analyzing discriminating characters like fruit growth, seed abortion and dehiscence zone development. Our data demonstrate that fruit morph determination is a ‘last-minute’ decision happening in flowers after anthesis directly before the first morphotypical differences start to occur. Several growth experiments in combination with hormone and gene expression analyses further indicate that an accumulation balance of the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin in open flowers together with the transcript abundance of the Ae. arabicum ortholog of BRANCHED1, encoding a transcription factor known for its conserved function as a branching repressor, may guide fruit morph determination. Thus, we hypothesize that the plasticity of the fruit morph ratio in Ae. arabicum may have evolved through the modification of a preexisting network known to govern correlative dominance between shoot organs.},

In response to diverse exogenous and endogenous cues including age, hormones, photoperiod, and temperature, the floral transition is controlled by a complex regulatory network, which involves extensive crosstalks, feedback, or feedforward loops between the components within flowering time pathways. The newly identified age pathway, which is controlled by microRNA156 (miR156) and its target SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING-LIKE (SPL) transcription factors, ensures plants flower under non-inductive conditions. In this review, I summarize the recent advance in understanding of the age pathway, focusing on the regulatory basis of the developmental decline in miR156 level by age and the molecular mechanism by which the age pathway is integrated into other flowering time pathways.},

	abstract = {Sex ratio theory predicts that, if prevailing ecological or social circumstances differentially inf luence the fitness benefits of offspring of each sex, parents should adjust their production accordingly to maximize fitness. For species in which sex is chromosomally determined, such as birds and mammals, a differential effect of maternal condition on the fitness of male and female young is one important route whereby selection is expected to favor a bias in the offspring sex ratio at birth or egg laying. However, despite its central place in sex allocation theory, this hypothesis has rarely been tested in wild populations. We manipulated maternal condition upward and downward in a sexually dimorphic wild bird and examined the effect on offspring survival and on offspring sex ratio. The survival to f ledging of male, but not female, young was substantially reduced if they came from less well provisioned eggs produced by females in relatively poor condition. As female condition, and thereby her capacity to produce high quality eggs, declined, she progressively skewed the sex ratio of her eggs toward females; i.e., she produced more of the sex with the higher survival prospects. The decline in the survival of male offspring, and the sex ratio bias, was removed when maternal condition was enhanced. These results provide experimental evidence of an adaptive, facultative adjustment of sex ratio in response to changes in maternal condition in wild birds.},

	abstract = {Offspring of older parents frequently show reduced longevity, but the mechanisms driving this so-called ‘Lansing effect' are unknown. While inheritance of short telomeres from older parents could underlie this effect, studies to date in different species have found mixed results, reporting positive, negative or no association between parental age and offspring telomere length (TL). However, most of the existing evidence is from non-experimental studies in which it is difficult to exclude alternative explanations such as differential survival of parents with different telomere lengths. Here we provide evidence in the zebra finch that offspring from older parents have reduced lifespans. As a first step in disentangling possible causes, we used an experimental approach to examine whether or not we could detect pre-natal paternal effects on offspring TL. We found that zebra finch embryos fathered by old males have shorter telomeres than those produced by the same mothers but with younger fathers. Since variation in embryonic TL persists into post-natal life, and early life TL is predictive of longevity in this species, this experimental study demonstrates that a paternally driven pre-natal TL reduction could at least in part underlie the reduced lifespan of offspring from older parents.},

Larger seeds yielded higher germination percentages, yet seed morphology had no additional direct effect on germination. Neither seed size nor seed morphology affected seedling growth. Neither germination nor seedling growth varied among populations, but seed head varied significantly. Results show that germination is mainly controlled by seed size rather than by seed morphology.

	abstract = {ABA Insensitive 5 (ABI5) is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that plays a key role in the regulation of seed germination and early seedling growth in the presence of ABA and abiotic stresses. ABI5 functions in the core ABA signaling, which is composed of PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors, PP2C phosphatases and SnRK2 kinases, through the regulation of the expression of genes that contain the ABSCISIC ACID RESPONSE ELEMENT (ABRE) motif within their promoter region. The regulated targets include stress adaptation genes, e.g., LEA proteins. However, the expression and activation of ABI5 is not only dependent on the core ABA signaling. Many transcription factors such as ABI3, ABI4, MYB7 and WRKYs play either a positive or a negative role in the regulation of ABI5 expression. Additionally, the stability and activity of ABI5 are also regulated by other proteins through post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation and S-nitrosylation. Moreover, ABI5 also acts as an ABA and other phytohormone signaling integrator. Components of auxin, cytokinin, gibberellic acid, jasmonate and brassinosteroid signaling and metabolism pathways were shown to take part in ABI5 regulation and/or to be regulated by ABI5. Monocot orthologs of AtABI5 have been identified. Although their roles in the molecular and physiological adaptations during abiotic stress have been elucidated, knowledge about their detailed action still remains elusive. Here, we describe the recent advances in understanding the action of ABI5 in early developmental processes and the adaptation of plants to unfavorable environmental conditions. We also focus on ABI5 relation to other phytohormones in the abiotic stress response of plants.},

Here, we show that TFL1 is recruited to thousands of loci by the bZIP transcription factor FD. We identify the master regulator of floral fate, LEAFY (LFY) as a target under dual opposite regulation by TFL1 and FT and uncover a pivotal role of FT in promoting flower fate via LFY upregulation. We provide evidence that the antagonism between FT and TFL1 relies on competition for chromatin-bound FD at shared target loci. Direct TFL1-FD regulated target genes identify this complex as a hub for repressing both master regulators of reproductive development and endogenous signalling pathways.

We demonstrate that SLs modulate polar auxin transport to control branching and that both the synthetic SL GR24 and endogenous SL synthesis significantly reduce the basipetal transport of a second branch-regulating hormone, auxin. Importantly, GR24 inhibits branching only in the presence of auxin in the main stem, and enhances competition between two branches on a common stem. Together, these results support two current hypotheses: that auxin moving down the main stem inhibits branch activity by preventing the establishment of auxin transport out of axillary branches; and that SLs act by dampening auxin transport, thus enhancing competition between branches.},

	abstract = {Large differences exist in the number of grains per spikelet across an individual wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) spike. The central spikelets produce the highest number of grains, while apical and basal spikelets are less productive, and the most basal spikelets are commonly only developed in rudimentary form. Basal spikelets are delayed in initiation, yet they continue to develop and produce florets. The precise timing or the cause of their abortion remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the underlying causes of basal spikelet abortion using shading applications in the field. We found that basal spikelet abortion is likely to be the consequence of complete floret abortion, as both occur concurrently and have the same response to shading treatments. We detected no differences in assimilate availability across the spike. Instead, we show that the reduced developmental age of basal florets pre-anthesis is strongly associated with their increased abortion. Using the developmental age pre-abortion, we were able to predict final grain set per spikelet across the spike, alongside the characteristic gradient in the number of grains from basal to central spikelets. Future efforts to improve spikelet homogeneity across the spike could thus focus on improving basal spikelet establishment and increasing floret development rates pre-abortion.},

Although much has been learned with regard to how each of these hormones act individually, we are just beginning to understand how these signals interact to achieve an integrated response. Previous studies indicated that exogenous cytokinin has an effect on the transcription of several PIN efflux carriers. Here we show that disruption of type-A Arabidopsis response regulators (ARRs), which are negative regulators of cytokinin signalling, alters the levels of PIN proteins and results in increased sensitivity to N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, an inhibitor of polar auxin transport. Disruption of eight of the 10 type-A ARR genes affects root development by altering the size of the apical meristem. Furthermore, we show that the effect of cytokinin on PIN abundance occurs primarily at the post-transcriptional level. Alterations of PIN levels in the type-A ARR mutants result in changes in the distribution of auxin in root tips as measured by a DR5::GFP reporter, and an altered pattern of cell division and differentiation in the stem cell niche in the root apical meristem. Together, these data indicate that cytokinin, acting through the type-A ARRs, alters the level of several PIN efflux carriers, and thus regulates the distribution of auxin within the root tip.},

Perception of both molecules in Arabidopsis thaliana requires the F-box protein MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2 (MAX2). Recent studies suggest that the homologous SUPPRESSOR OF MAX2 1 (SMAX1) in Arabidopsis and DWARF53 (D53) in rice (Oryza sativa) are downstream targets of MAX2. Through an extensive analysis of loss-of-function mutants, we demonstrate that the Arabidopsis SMAX1-LIKE genes SMXL6, SMXL7, and SMXL8 are co-orthologs of rice D53 that promote shoot branching. SMXL7 is degraded rapidly after treatment with the synthetic strigolactone mixture rac-GR24. Like D53, SMXL7 degradation is MAX2- and D14-dependent and can be prevented by deletion of a putative P-loop. Loss of SMXL6,7,8 suppresses several other strigolactone-related phenotypes in max2, including increased auxin transport and PIN1 accumulation, and increased lateral root density. Although only SMAX1 regulates germination and hypocotyl elongation, SMAX1 and SMXL6,7,8 have complementary roles in the control of leaf morphology. Our data indicate that SMAX1 and SMXL6,7,8 repress karrikin and strigolactone signaling, respectively, and suggest that all MAX2-dependent growth effects are mediated by degradation of SMAX1/SMXL proteins. We propose that functional diversification within the SMXL family enabled responses to different butenolide signals through a shared regulatory mechanism.},

	abstract = {In Arabidopsis, several genetic pathways controlling the floral transition (flowering) are integrated at the transcriptional regulation of FT, LFY and SOC1.TSF is the closest homolog of FT in Arabidopsis. TSF expression was induced rapidly upon activation of CONSTANS (CO). The mRNA levels of TSF and FT showed similar patterns of diurnal oscillation and response to photoperiods: an evening peak, higher levels in long day (LD) than in short day (SD) conditions, and immediate up-regulation upon day-length extension. These observations suggest that TSF is a direct regulatory target of CO. tsf mutation delayed flowering in SD conditions and enhanced the phenotype of ft in both LD and SD conditions. TSF and FT also shared similar modes of regulation by FLC, an integrator of autonomous and vernalization pathways, and other factors such as EBS and PHYB. Consistently, TSF overexpression caused a precocious flowering phenotype independent of photoperiods or CO, or FLC. These observations suggest that TSF is a new member of the floral pathway integrators and promotes flowering largely redundantly with FT but makes a distinct contribution in SD conditions. TSF and FT seem to act independently of each other and of LFY, and partially upstream of SOC1. Interestingly, the expression patterns of TSF and FT in seedlings did not overlap, although both were expressed in the phloem tissues. Our work revealed additional complexity and spatial aspects of the regulatory network at the pathway integration level. We propose that the phloem is the site where multiple regulatory pathways are integrated at the transcriptional regulation of FT and TSF.},

The results showed that higher levels of endogenous trehalose benefited wheat resistance to low-temperature stress. Exogenous trehalose inhibited floret degeneration and increased floret fertility in the apical spikelets, thus significantly alleviating the decrease in grain number per spike caused by low temperature. The results of the metabolomics analysis as well as the physiological indexes showed that trehalose significantly promoted the assimilation of nitrogen in florets under low-temperature stress, thus reducing the accumulation of ammonium ions in the plant cells. In addition, exogenous trehalose significantly increased the endogenous spermidine level in florets, increased their glutathione and ascorbic acid contents, promoted the glutathione-ascorbic acid cycle, and thereby reduced the contents of reactive oxygen species in florets. This may be an important physiological mechanism by which trehalose alleviates the effect of low-temperature stress on floret development in wheat.},

Cold stress at booting, i.e., 12 h at sub-zero temperatures (-3 to -5ºC), did not affect the number of florets (per spike!) but it affected the number of fertile florets.


Specifically due to reduction of fertile florets in the apical and basal spikelets.


Cold stress increased total soluble sugar content in the florets. It also increased sucrose and reduced trehalose content, again, in the florets.


Trehalose content significantly correlated with the number of fertile florets.


External application of trehalose did not have any effect at 20ºC, but it increased the number of fertile florets in the cold-treated plants.


Specifically by partially alleviating the effect of the cold stress on the apical spikelets.

In the present study, we evaluated NILs differing in the recently identified Eps-7D as well as in Ppd-D1 at three temperature regimes (9, 15 and 18 °C) under short day. The effect of Eps-7D on time to anthesis as well as on its component phases varied both qualitatively and quantitatively depending on the allelic status of Ppd-D1 and temperature, being larger in a photoperiod-sensitive background. A more noticeable effect of Eps-7D (when combined with Ppd-D1b) was realised during the late reproductive phase. Consequently, the final leaf number was not clearly altered by Eps-7D, while floret development of the labile florets (florets 2 and 3 in this case, depending on the particular spikelet) was favoured by the action of the Eps-7D-late allele, increasing the likelihood of particular florets to become fertile, and consequently, improving spike fertility when combined with Ppd-D1b.},

Eps-7D affected time to anthesis as expected and the Eps-7D-late allele extended both the period before and after terminal spikelet. The interaction effect of Eps-7D × temperature was significant but not cross-over: the magnitude and level of significance of the difference between NILs with the late or early allele was affected by the growing temperature (i.e., difference was least at 18 °C and largest at 9 °C), and the differences caused due to temperature sensitivity were influenced by photoperiod. The rate of leaf initiation was faster in NIL with Eps-7D-early than with the late allele which compensated for the shorter duration of leaf initiation resulting in similar final leaf number between two NILs. Eps-7D-late consistently increased spike fertility through improving floret primordia survival as a consequence of extending the late reproductive phase.},

We evaluated eight lines derived from crossing two vernalisation insensitive lines, Paragon and Baj (late and early flowering respectively), to study the detailed effects of two newly identified QTLs, Eps-7D and Eps-2B and their interactions under field conditions. The effect of both QTLs was minor and was affected by the allelic status of the other. While the magnitude of effect of these QTLs on anthesis was similar, they are associated with very different profiles of pre-anthesis development which also depends on their interaction. Eps-7D affected both duration before and after terminal spikelet while not affecting final leaf number (FLN) so Eps-7D-early had a faster rate of leaf appearance. Eps-2B acted more specifically in the early reproductive phase and slightly altered FLN without affecting the leaf appearance rate. Both QTLs affected the spike fertility by altering the rate of floret development and mortality. The effect of Eps-2B was very small but consistent in that -late allele tended to produce more fertile florets.},

Late reproductive phase (LRP) encompases floret initiation and survival.


Duration of LRP determines the generation and degeneration of florets and grains.


Vrn and Ppd genes are responsible for the sensitivity to vernalization and photoperiod, respectively.


Eps (earliness per se) genes are independent of vernalization and photoperiod but control flowering time.


Effect of Eps genes is much smaller than that of Vrn and Ppd.


Findings


Identification of 2 heading date QTLs, these are Eps QTLS named Eps-7D and Eps-2B.


The two loci interact.


They control the rate of initiation of florets and of floret survival, as well as the number of final fertile florets.


Eps-7D could be related to FT-D1. Eps-2B could be related to Ppd-B1 but this does not make a lot of sense.

	abstract = {The increasing demand for global food security in the face of a warming climate is leading researchers to investigate the physiological and molecular responses of cereals to rising ambient temperatures. Wheat and barley are temperate cereals whose yields are adversely affected by high ambient temperatures, with each 1 °C increase above optimum temperatures reducing productivity by 5–6\%. Reproductive development is vulnerable to high-temperature stress, which reduces yields by decreasing grain number and/or size and weight. In recent years, analysis of early inflorescence development and genetic pathways that control the vegetative to floral transition have elucidated molecular processes that respond to rising temperatures, including those involved in the vernalization- and photoperiod-dependent control of flowering. In comparison, our understanding of genes that underpin thermal responses during later developmental stages remains poor, thus highlighting a key area for future research. This review outlines the responses of developmental genes to warmer conditions and summarizes our knowledge of the reproductive traits of wheat and barley influenced by high temperatures. We explore ways in which recent advances in wheat and barley research capabilities could help identify genes that underpin responses to rising temperatures, and how improved knowledge of the genetic regulation of reproduction and plant architecture could be used to develop thermally resilient cultivars.},

Although the effects of Eps genes are often assumed to act independently of the environment, previous studies have shown that they exhibit temperature sensitivity. The number of leaves and phyllochron are considered determinants of flowering time and the numerical components of yield include spikelets per spike and fertile floret number within spikelets. We studied the dynamics of leaf, spikelet, and floret development in near isogenic lines with either late or early alleles of Eps-D1 under seven temperature regimes. Leaf appearance dynamics were modulated by temperature, and Eps alleles had a greater effect on the period from flag leaf to heading than phyllochron. In addition, the effects of the Eps alleles on spikelets per spike were minor, and more related to spikelet plastochron than the duration of the early reproductive phase. However, fertile floret number was affected by the interaction between Eps alleles and temperature. So, at 9 °C, Eps-early alleles had more fertile florets than Eps-late alleles, at intermediate temperatures there was no significant difference, and at 18 °C (the highest temperature) the effect was reversed, with lines carrying the late allele producing more fertile florets. These effects were mediated through changes in floret survival; there were no clear effects on the maximum number of floret primordia.},

In wheat, vernalization predominantly involves the cold upregulation of the floral activator VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1). Here, we have used an extreme vernalization response, identified through studying ambient temperature responses, to reveal the complexity of temperature inputs into VRN-A1, with allelic inter-copy variation at a gene expansion of VRN-A1 modulating these effects. We find that the repressors of the reproductive transition, VERNALIZATION2 (VRN2) and ODDSOC2, are re-activated when plants experience high temperatures during and after vernalization. In addition, this re-activation is regulated by photoperiod for VRN2 but was independent of photoperiod for ODDSOC2. We also find this warm temperature interruption affects flowering time and floret number and is stage specific. This research highlights the important balance between floral activators and repressors in coordinating the response of a plant to temperature, and that the absence of warmth is essential for the completion of vernalization. This knowledge can be used to develop agricultural germplasm with more predictable vernalization responses that will be more resilient to variable growth temperatures.},

(Some) Eps genes affect not only the timing of anthesis but also the number of fertile florets.


Plants carrying late flowering Eps alleles tend to have slightly more fertile florets.


This is particularly notable in the central spikelets. 


This is, according to the authors, due to a REDUCED FLORET MORTALITY, which is caused by an IMPROVED DEVELOPMENT of labile florets when the Eps allele was in the late form.


So, essentially, for lines with different Eps alleles, differences in the number of ‘surviving’ (fertile) florets are due to the degree of floret development.


(My interpretation) For a floret not to die, it needs to reach a certain developmental stage.

Experiments under controlled and irrigated field conditions relevant to the northern wheat growing region of Australia were designed. In vernalised plants, the number of fertile florets in the main shoot spike was positively related to the number of fertile spikelets, the duration of SE, the SDW at anthesis and the sum of the radiation intercepted during SE, while no associations were found under non vernalised and slow vernalising field conditions. Vernalised plants also produced more grains in the average tiller spike, compared to non vernalised plants, particularly under short days. Both main shoot and tiller grain number per spike contributed to the higher grain number per plant observed in vernalised plants in Steinfort et al. (2016), as spike number was similar. In the field, higher yield of lines with spring alleles of VRN1 was underpinned by longer spikes, with fewer spikelets but more fertile florets per spikelet in the main shoot spike, and more grains per tiller. When non vernalised, winter lines had an apex that grew slower, shorter spikes and higher spikelet density compared to the other genotypes.

Vernalization increases the number of fertile florets in basal but not in central or apical spikelets.


In vernalized plants, basal spikelets had floret primordia that were more advanced in development compared to non-vernalized plants.


Higher number of florets per spike when plants are vernalized under short days.

Three characteristic phases of floret development:


Initiation (I), with gradually decreasing rate


Degeneration (II), with high and stable rate


Abortion (III), negligible




Floret development is similar between the main stem and tillers.





The effect of vernalization on floret development depends on the genotype (winter or spring accession).


Late planting (no vernalization) decreases the total number of florets per spike in both winter and spring accessions.


When planted early (September, with vernalization), floret numbers are higher in the winter accession (presumably because it vernalized). When planted late (March, no vernalization), they are higher in the spring accession.


Duration of floret initiation (in GDD) is longer in the spring accession for the middle planting. For the late planting, it is similar for both accessions.


Vernalization decreases the duration of floret initiation, only in the winter accession.

The number of fertile florets is affected by the duration of the stem elongation phase. 


When the period between terminal spikelet and flowering (heading) is longer, the number of fertile florets PER SPIKELET is greater.

The hypotheses were tested under elevated CO2, combined with +3°C above ambient temperature and terminal drought, using specialized field tunnel houses. Elevated CO2 increased net leaf photosynthetic rates and likely the availability of carbon assimilates, which significantly reduced the rates of floret death and increased the potential number of grains at anthesis in both sister lines by an average of 42\%. The restricted-tillering line had faster grain-filling rates than the free-tillering line because the free-tillering line had more grains to fill. Furthermore, grain-filling rates were faster under elevated CO2 and +3°C above ambient. Terminal drought reduced grain yield in both lines by 19\%. Elevated CO2 alone increased the potential number of grains, but a trade-off in yield components limited grain yield in the free-tillering line. This emphasizes the need for breeding cultivars with a greater potential number of florets, since this was not affected by the predicted future climate variables.},

The amount of C assimilates needed to produce florets is almost insignificant compared with the amount needed to sustain their growth and development. This implies that the availability of C assimilates should benefit floret survival rather than floret production.


Findings


Effect of slight increase in temperature (+3ºC).


Beginning of floret initiation could be a little bit delayed in higher temperature (from the graph).


Rate of floret production unaffected by temperature, it seems.


Maximum number of florets slightly greater in higher temperature. More notable in restricted-tillering lines.


Duration of floret initiation in ºCd seems more or less the same.


Degradation of florets is at the same rate more or less. 


Surviving florets more or less the same, despite differences in the maximum number of florets produced.


Higher temperature hastened the number of floret deaths…

Four recombinant inbred lines contrasting for stem WSC were grown at 20/10 C and 11 h photoperiod until terminal spikelet, and then continued in a factorial combination of 20/10 C or 28/14 C with 11 h or 16 h photoperiod until anthesis. Across environments, High WSC lines had more grains per spike associated with more ﬂorets per spike. The number of fertile ﬂorets was associated with spike biomass at booting and, by extension, with glucose amount, both higher in High WSC lines. At booting, High WSC lines had higher ﬁxed 13C and higher levels of expression of genes involved in photosynthesis and sucrose transport and lower in sucrose degradation compared with Low WSC lines. At higher temperature, the intrinsic rate of ﬂoret development rate before booting was slower in High WSC lines. Grain set declined with the intrinsic rate of ﬂoret development before booting, with an advantage for High WSC lines at 28/14 C and 16 h.

During spikelet initiation, the identity of the shoot meristem switches from the vegetative to the reproductive stage and spikelet primordia are formed on the apex. Subsequently, floral morphogenesis is initiated, a process strongly affected by environmental variation. Recent studies in cereal grasses have suggested that this later phase of inflorescence development controls floret survival and abortion, and is therefore crucial for yield. Here, we provide a synthesis of the early morphological and the more recent genetic studies on shoot development in wheat and barley. The review explores how photoperiod, abiotic stress, and nutrient signalling interact with shoot development, and pinpoints genetic factors that mediate development in response to these environmental cues. We anticipate that research in these areas will be important in understanding adaptation of cereal grasses to changing climate conditions.},

The metabolic cost of initiating floret primordia is very low compared to that of maintaining floret growth to the stage of a fertile floret.


Higher number of fertile floret per spike is associated with longer duration of late reproductive phase.


Number of fertile florets is also regulated by autophagy = a self degradative process by which cell organelles are eliminated.


Development generates sugar starvation, which triggers floret autophagy.


Nitrogen fertilization does not affect the initiation of florets, but it accelerates the rate of floret development, improving their survival.





In barley, high floret fertility is associated with induction of FT1 in leaf and FT2 in meristem, this is dependent on long-day photoperiods and allelic variation at Ppd.


T6P relays information about carbohydrate availability to other signaling pathways.


Reduced TPS1 expression cause down-regulation of FT in leaf and late flowering in Arabidopsis.

A longer period of spike growth would lead to an increased number of FF and grains in wheat. The aim of this study was: (i) to analyze in three different commercial cultivars the impact of a photoperiod extension (NP + 10) during the stem elongation phase on the number of FF and (ii) to determine whether the photoperiod extension effect might be reversed by increasing the availability of assimilates by a direct modiﬁcation of the source/sink ratio at booting. The number of FF per spike was reduced by extended photoperiod in the experiment sown in an optimum date, though no differences were observed when sown much later, probably due to the poor environmental conditions of a spring sowing. The detrimental effect of lengthening the photoperiod on the number of FF per spike was reversed by trimming the spike at booting in two of the three cultivars analyzed. This reversion, together with the effect of photoperiod extension on FF associated with similar effects on spike growth, may be considered as a conﬁrmation that, at least in part, the detrimental effects of photoperiod extension on FF would be mediated by changes in assimilate supply to the developing ﬂorets. No differences were observed between photoperiod treatments on the onset of rapid spike growth; however, extended photoperiod reduced the duration of spike growth phase without differences in the maximum rate of spike growth in two of the three cultivars. Although a positive association was found between the number of FF and spike dry weight at anthesis, differences among cultivars were observed in this relationship, suggesting different carbohydrates partitioning (i.e., FF per unit of spike weight) among them.},

Long photoperiod decreases the length of time between TS and flowering. It also reduces the number of fertile florets PER SPIKE.


Long photoperiod accelerates the rate of development of floret primordia.


Because it also advances anthesis, there is overall a detrimental effect, so the floret is less likely to become fertile.

	abstract = {The manipulation of photoperiod sensitivity during stem elongation (terminal spikelet initiationÐanthesis) has been suggested as a means to increase wheat yield potential. Nevertheless, photoperiod sensitivity and the interaction with vernalization during that phase have not been previously explored under ®eld conditions. Thus, a ®eld study was carried out (i) to assess whether duration of stem elongation is sensitive to photoperiod experienced only during that phase, and if so (ii) to evaluate whether vernalization interacts with this photoperiod response and (iii) to determine if altering duration of stem elongation may in¯uence wheat yield and its components. The experiment was a factorial combination of two vernalization treatments (15 (V15) or 50 (V50) days at 4 Æ 1 8C and 8 h photoperiod), two photoperiod regimes during stem elongation (natural daylength in the ®eld NP  0 and one daylength extension of 6 h NP  6) and three cultivars (Buck Manantial (BM), Eureka Ferrocarril Sur (EFS), and ProINTA Puntal (PP)). The stem elongation phase responded to the actual photoperiod experienced during that phase in the three cultivars, increasing its duration with shorter photoperiod. In the vernalization-sensitive cultivars EFS and PP, plants vernalized 50 days showed greater response to photoperiod than those vernalized 15 days. In the most photoperiod-sensitive cultivar (BM), as duration of stem elongation lengthened by exposure to less inductive photoperiod, a higher number of fertile ¯orets at anthesis was achieved leading to an increased grain number and thereby to a higher wheat yield. These results reinforce the idea that a longer duration of stem elongation may offer an alternative avenue to improve yield potential in wheat.},

Furthermore, we characterize the pattern of historical recombination and observe an enrichment of hotspots in intergenic regions and repetitive DNA, consistent with the pattern observed for humans but strikingly different from other plant species. We are making seeds for this Regional Mapping (RegMap) panel publicly available; they comprise the largest genomic mapping resource available for a naturally occurring, non-human, species.},

After discussing the problem On a basis combining intuition with some hard, cold facts about the distributions of certain test quantities (or "statistics") a simple and definite procedure is proposed for dividing treatments into distinguishable groups, and for determining that the treatments within some of these groups are different, although there is not enough evidence to say "which is which."

We demonstrate that the Arabidopsis TERMINAL FLOWER 1 gene has a unified effect on the rate of progression of the shoot apex through different developmental phases. In transgenic Arabidopsis plants which ectopically express TERMINAL FLOWER 1, both the vegetative and reproductive phases are greatly extended. As a consequence, these plants exhibit dramatic changes in their overall morphology, producing an enlarged vegetative rosette of leaves, followed by a highly branched inflorescence which eventually forms normal flowers. Activity of the floral meristem identity genes LEAFY and APETALA 1 is not directly inhibited by TERMINAL FLOWER 1, but their upregulation is markedly delayed compared to wild-type controls. These phenotypic and molecular effects complement those observed in the tfl1 mutant, where all phases are shortened. The results suggest that TERMINAL FLOWER 1 participates in a common mechanism underlying major shoot apical phase transitions, rather than there being unrelated mechanisms which regulate each specific transition during the life cycle.},

	abstract = {Perennials have a complex shoot architecture with axillary meristems organized in zones of differential bud activity and fate. This includes zones of buds maintained dormant for multiple seasons and used as reservoirs for potential growth in case of damage. The shoot of Arabis alpina, a perennial relative of Arabidopsis thaliana, consists of a zone of dormant buds placed between subapical vegetative and basal flowering branches. This shoot architecture is shaped after exposure to prolonged cold, required for flowering. To understand how vernalization ensures the maintenance of dormant buds, we performed physiological and transcriptome studies, followed the spatiotemporal changes of auxin, and generated transgenic plants. Our results demonstrate that the complex shoot architecture in A. alpina is shaped by its flowering behavior, specifically the initiation of inflorescences during cold treatment and rapid flowering after subsequent exposure to growth-promoting conditions. Dormant buds are already formed before cold treatment. However, dormancy in these buds is enhanced during, and stably maintained after, vernalization by a BRC1-dependent mechanism. Post-vernalization, stable maintenance of dormant buds is correlated with increased auxin response, transport, and endogenous indole-3-acetic acid levels in the stem. Here, we provide a functional link between flowering and the maintenance of dormant buds in perennials.},

	abstract = {Yield components are relatively easy to measure and their interpretation is intuitive. However, strong environmental influences, genetic and physiological controls, and evolutionary constraints collectively lead to lack of independence among yield components that restrict their value in breeding and agronomic applications. Here, we first sketch a framework of plant responses to environmental factors to highlight the modulation of yield components by resources and their interplay with non-resource factors including developmental cues (e.g. maternal effects), extreme events (e.g. frost), predicting factors (e.g. photoperiod) and synchronising and integrating information (e.g. spectral composition of light). We suggest that, to the extent that non-resource cues allow plants to predict future availability of resources, simple resource-based models may be sufficient to capture the macroscopic responses of yield components to the environment. Next, we expand the original concept of hierarchy of plasticities between grain size (a relatively stable trait) and grain number (a plastic trait) to test the hypothesis of a broader hierarchy in the plasticities of yield components. Using published data for wheat, rice, barley and triticale, we verified that heritabilities capture the established hierarchy between plasticity of grain size and number. Median heritabilities of 0.31 for tiller number, 0.58 for inflorescence number, 0.59 for grains per inflorescence, and 0.79 for grain size supported the hierarchy of plasticities: tiller number{\textgreater}inflorescence number≈grains per inflorescence{\textgreater}seed size. The heritability of grain yield was consistently higher than the heritability for tillering, consistently lower than the heritability for grain size, and suggestively close to the heritability of inflorescence number and grains per inflorescence, the components of grain number per unit ground area. We conclude that understanding the environmental regulation of yield components in cereals would benefit from a dual focus on yield-related traits per se and their plasticity.},

Autophagy also plays a housekeeping role in removing misfolded or aggregated proteins, clearing damaged organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes, as well as eliminating intracellular pathogens. Thus, autophagy is generally thought of as a survival mechanism, although its deregulation has been linked to non-apoptotic cell death. Autophagy can be either non-selective or selective in the removal of specific organelles, ribosomes and protein aggregates, although the mechanisms regulating aspects of selective autophagy are not fully worked out. In addition to elimination of intracellular aggregates and damaged organelles, autophagy promotes cellular senescence and cell surface antigen presentation, protects against genome instability and prevents necrosis, giving it a key role in preventing diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, liver disease, autoimmune diseases and infections. This review summarizes the most up-to-date findings on how autophagy is executed and regulated at the molecular level and how its disruption can lead to disease.},

Plants from which all tillers were removed were grown at 21/10°C with a 14 h photoperiod. At flag leaf emergence, an additional light (15\% above control) and two shading treatments (40 and 70\% below control) were applied to the plants for an 8-day period, ending 6 days before anthesis. The additional light and the 70\% shade treatments had significant effects (+37\%, -43\% respectively), on the number of competent florets (as judged by anther appearance at anthesis) and subsequently similar effects on the number of kernels per spike at maturity. The changes in competent floret numbers were closely related to changes in spike dry weight at anthesis and in turn, during the treatment period. The heavy shading decreased grain yield significantly. Within the spike, treatment effects on floret and kernel number were greater in basal spikelets than in distal and especially central spikelets, in both an absolute as well as relative sense. These effects were paralleled by greater changes in basal spikelet dry weight and water-soluble carbohydrate concentration. They may be related to the smaller size or later development of basal spikelets at the onset of treatment, and suggest that the base of the spike is normally a lower priority sink for assimilate at that time.},

Long days accelerated spike and floret development and greening, and the expression of genes involved in photosynthesis, photoprotection and carbohydrate metabolism. These changes started while the spike was in the light-depleted environment created by the surrounding leaf sheaths. Cell division ceased in the tissues of distal florets, which interrupted their normal developmental progression and initiated autophagy, thus decreasing the number of fertile florets at anthesis. A massive decrease in the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, a decrease in soluble carbohydrate levels, and an increase in the expression of genes involved in programmed cell death accompanied anatomical signs of cell death, and these effects were stronger under long days. We propose a model in which developmentally generated sugar starvation triggers floret autophagy, and long days intensify these processes due to the increased carbohydrate consumption caused by the accelerated plant development.},

The dynamics of floret generation/degeneration were studied in contrasting conditions of nitrogen (N) and water availability of modern, well-adapted, durum wheats in order to understand further the bases for grain number determination. Experiments were carried out during the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 growing seasons at Lleida (NE Spain). The first experiment involved four cultivars (Claudio, Donduro, Simeto, and Vitron) and two contrasting N availabilities (50 kgN ha(-1) and 250 kgN ha(-1); N50 and N250) while experiment 2 included the two cultivars most contrasting in grain setting responsiveness to N in experiment 1, and two levels of N (N50 and N250), under irrigated (IR) and rainfed (RF) conditions. In addition, a detillering treatment was imposed on both cultivars under the IR+N250 condition. The number of fertile florets at anthesis was increased by {\textasciitilde}30\% in response to N fertilization (averaging across treatments and spikelet positions). The effect of N and water availability was evident on floret developmental rates from the third floret primordium onwards, as these florets in the central spikelets of all genotypes reached the stage of a fertile floret in N250 while in N50 they did not. In this study, clear differences were found between the cultivars in their responsiveness to N by producing more fertile florets at anthesis (through accelerating developmental rates of floret primordia), by increasing the likelihood of particular grains to be set, or by both traits.},

The genetic basis regulating flowering in cereals is well understood, but there are reports that flowering time can be modified at a high frequency by selective breeding, suggesting that it may be regulated by both epigenetic and genetic mechanisms. We investigated the role of DNA methylation in regulating spikelet number and flowering time by treating a semi-spring wheat with the demethylating agent, Zebularine. Three lines with a heritable increase in spikelet number were identified. The molecular basis for increased spikelet number was not determined in 2 lines, but the phenotype showed non-Mendelian inheritance, suggesting that it could have an epigenetic basis. In the remaining line, the increased spikelet phenotype behaved as a Mendelian recessive trait and late flowering was associated with a deletion encompassing the floral promoter, FT-B1. Deletion of FT-B1 delayed the transition to reproductive growth, extended the duration of spike development, and increased spikelet number under different temperature regimes and photoperiod. Transiently disrupting DNA methylation can generate novel flowering behaviour in wheat, but these changes may not be sufficiently stable for use in breeding programs.},

              is linked completely to a gene similar to

              ).
              FT
              induction in the leaves results in a transmissible signal that promotes flowering. Transcript levels of the barley and wheat orthologues, designated as
              HvFT
              and
              TaFT
              , respectively, are significantly higher in plants homozygous for the dominant
              Vrn3
              alleles (early flowering) than in plants homozygous for the recessive
              vrn3
              alleles (late flowering). In wheat, the dominant
              Vrn3
              allele is associated with the insertion of a retroelement in the

              VRN-B3

              P

              transcript levels by vernalization in barley winter plants (
              P

In cultivars with a high final spikelet number, fertility towards the tip of the ear was linked with the establishment of many spikelet primordia before the appearance of glume initials and with the concurrent development of spikelets. Development of the ear of Triticale was also sensitive to day length, with the formation of up to 50 spikelets under an 8 hr photoperiod. The large number of spikelets was achieved by long duration and high rates of production, which were in excess of those for wheat under corresponding photoperiods.

	abstract = {Vernalization requirement and response to day length are the major factors controlling development in wheat (Triticum aesitvum L.). This study was to determine how they integrate in the field in Obregon, Sonora, Mexico to result in development phenotype. In addition to a natural day-length treatment, day length was shortened in a second treatment by covering the crop from 0.5 h before twilight until 1.0 h past sunrise, extended in a third treatment by illumination from 0.5 h before until 3.0 h after sunset for the entire season, and extended by the same amount in a fourth treatment beginning 47 days after planting. Development of one facultative, one winter, six spring cultivars, and ten F)-derived F5 lines from the spring-spring cross Pfau/Weaver was followed by dissection of plants every two days. In addition to the nonvernalized treatment, cultivars were also subjected to six weeks of vernalization in darkness at 6°C prior to planting in the field. Beginning two days after germination in the field, the spring, facultative, and winter cultivars Oasis, TAM 200, and CenturklVeery 5, respectively, were also moved to a cold chamber and subjected to 6°C and day lengths simulating those outdoors for three weeks before being returned to the field. After germination, all entries were insensitive to day length. During this phase, development was vegetative and no progress was made towards flowering. Without vernalization, this juvenile phase was 68 and 40 d long in winter and facultative cultivars, respectively, and ranged from between 20 and 33 d in spring genotypes. The subsequent day length sensitive phase was always associated with the shift from vegetative to reproductive development. All cultivars, when vernalized for six weeks and subsequently transplanted to the field on the same day when nonvernalized plants received their initial irrigation, shifted from vegetative to reproductive. development earlier than their nonvernalized counterparts. A vernalization treatment after normal germination in the field, either extended or did not effect the duration of the juvenile phase. After the juvenile phase, all entries developed more quickly towards flowering the longer the day. Whenever an entry had initiated the spike, spikelet, or floret prior to day 47, when the second extended day-length treatment was imposed, the development of the respective organ was not influenced. The later flowering of winter and facultative than that of spring wheats is due largely to their long juvenile phases. Vernalizing temperatures do not shorten the juvenile phase through a response to cold per se, but rather by allowing part of it to be transgressed during a time of minimal growth. After the juvenile phase, all genotypes move into the reproductive phase with a concomitant response to day length. They do not vary in being either sensitive or insensitive to day length, but rather in the rate of development towards flowering which any given length of day provokes. Response to day length determined the duration of spikelet initiation and how quickly each spikelet progressed towards flowering.},

The dynamics of floret generation/degeneration were studied in contrasting conditions of nitrogen (N) and water availability of modern, well-adapted, durum wheats in order to understand further the bases for grain number determination. Experiments were carried out during the 2008–2009 and 2009–2010 growing seasons at Lleida (NE Spain). The first experiment involved four cultivars (Claudio, Donduro, Simeto, and Vitron) and two contrasting N availabilities (50 kgN ha–1 and 250 kgN ha–1; N50 and N250) while experiment 2 included the two cultivars most contrasting in grain setting responsiveness to N in experiment 1, and two levels of N (N50 and N250), under irrigated (IR) and rainfed (RF) conditions. In addition, a detillering treatment was imposed on both cultivars under the IR+N250 condition. The number of fertile florets at anthesis was increased by {\textasciitilde}30\% in response to N fertilization (averaging across treatments and spikelet positions). The effect of N and water availability was evident on floret developmental rates from the third floret primordium onwards, as these florets in the central spikelets of all genotypes reached the stage of a fertile floret in N250 while in N50 they did not. In this study, clear differences were found between the cultivars in their responsiveness to N by producing more fertile florets at anthesis (through accelerating developmental rates of floret primordia), by increasing the likelihood of particular grains to be set, or by both traits.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND For over a century, genetic diversity of wheat worldwide was eroded by continual selection for high yields and industrial demands. Wheat landraces cultivated in Israel and Palestine demonstrate high genetic diversity and a potentially wide repertoire of adaptive alleles. While most Israeli-Palestinian wheat landraces were lost in the transition to ‘Green Revolution’ semi-dwarf varieties, some germplasm collections made at the beginning of the 20th century survived in gene banks and private collections worldwide. However, fragmentation and poor conservation place this unique genetic resource at a high risk of genetic erosion. Herein, we describe a long-term initiative to restore, conserve, and characterize a collection of Israeli and Palestinian wheat landraces (IPLR). RESULTS We report on (i) the IPLR construction (n = 932), (ii) the historical and agronomic context to this collection, (iii) the characterization and assessment of the IPLR's genetic diversity, and (iv) a data comparison from two distinct subcollections within IPLR: a collection made by N. Vavilov in 1926 (IPLR-VIR) and a later one (1979–1981) made by Y. Mattatia (IPLR-M). Though conducted in the same eco-geographic space, these two collections were subjected to considerably different conservation pathways. IPLR-M, which underwent only one propagation cycle, demonstrated marked genetic and phenotypic variability (within and between accessions) in comparison with IPLR-VIR, which had been regularly regenerated over ∼90 years. CONCLUSION We postulate that long-term ex situ conservation involving human and genotype × environment selection may significantly reduce accession heterogeneity and allelic diversity. Results are further discussed in a broader context of pre-breeding and conservation. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry},

	abstract = {Recent advances in crop research have the potential to accelerate genetic gains in wheat, especially if co-ordinated with a breeding perspective. For example, improving photosynthesis by exploiting natural variation in Rubisco's catalytic rate or adopting C4 metabolism could raise the baseline for yield potential by 50\% or more. However, spike fertility must also be improved to permit full utilization of photosynthetic capacity throughout the crop life cycle and this has several components. While larger radiation use efficiency will increase the total assimilates available for spike growth, thereby increasing the potential for grain number, an optimized phenological pattern will permit the maximum partitioning of the available assimilates to the spikes. Evidence for underutilized photosynthetic capacity during grain filling in elite material suggests unnecessary floret abortion. Therefore, a better understanding of its physiological and genetic basis, including possible signalling in response to photoperiod or growth-limiting resources, may permit floret abortion to be minimized for a more optimal source:sink balance. However, trade-offs in terms of the partitioning of assimilates to competing sinks during spike growth, to improve root anchorage and stem strength, may be necessary to prevent yield losses as a result of lodging. Breeding technologies that can be used to complement conventional approaches include wide crossing with members of the Triticeae tribe to broaden the wheat genepool, and physiological and molecular breeding strategically to combine complementary traits and to identify elite progeny more efficiently.},

	abstract = {Conflicting reports exist about the effect of N supply on the rate of leaf emergence. We examined effects of N deficiency on leaf and tiller emergence, tiller initiation and apical development in ‘Aroona’ and ‘Gamenya’ spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Four levels of N (e.g., 50 μM N = N50) were supplied by hourly irrigation with complete nutrient solution of plants growing in sand. The control plants in Exp. 1 (N1600) had 64 g kg-1 N intheshoots at the two-leaf stag e, compared with 33 in N50, 50 in N300, and 58 in N800. Compared with control plants, dry matter of N50 plants was 10\%, N300 50\%, and N800 80\%. Results in Exp. 2 were similar. The rate of leaf emergence was decreased in all N50-treated and some N200-treated plants, but not or N300-treated plants. Tiller bud initiation was decreased in the treatment. The number of tiller buds was correlated with total number of leaves; if a leaf emerged, N deficiency did not affect tiller initiation. Nitrogen treatment did not alter the sequence of tiller emergence, but tiller emergence was delayed or did not occur in N50, N200, and N300 plants. Nitrogen treatment had little effect on the rate of apical development. The double-ridge stage of development was delayed ≈2 d for both cultivars at the two lowest N treatments. Terminal spikelet production was also delayed by ≈2 d at these N treatments in Aroona, but not in Gamenya spring wheat. The rate of primordia initiation was decreased in N50 and N300 plants, resulting in fewer spikelet primordia. The level of N deficiency affected plant response to the stress.},

Nitrogen significantly increased tiller numbers, dry matter and grain yields per plant. Maximum plant size resulted from the N30 treatment, but maximum grain yields per plant from the N10 treatment. Total spikelet numbers increased with increasing nitrogen supply up to the N30 treatment, and this was due to increased rates of spikelet primordia production. Nitrogen treatments had almost no effect on the duration of spikelet primordium formation. Only two ear-bearing tillers were produced in the N10 and N30 treatments, and none in the others. Tiller apices had a similar, or in the case of the second tiller of N30 plants a 29\% higher, rate of spikelet primordia formation to that of the associated main shoot, and all apices formed terminal spikelets at a similar time. The second tiller did not initiate primordia production until 25\% of final spikelet numbers were present on the main shoot apex. The higher grain yield per plant in the N10 than in the N30 treatment was due largely to more grains per fertile spikelet on the tillers of N10 plants. It was speculated that the poorer performance of tillers on N30 plants was due to mutual shading of shoots and/or poorer nitrogen nutrition of the tiller apices owing to the method of nitrogen application. It was concluded that nitrogen supply affected grain yield per ear more by influencing the ability of florets to set grain than by varying spikelet number.},

	abstract = {Seasonal developmental plasticity, which consists of season-dependent alternations of developmental processes, has evolved to produce optimal phenotypes depending on specific periods in a year. For example, many phenological events in plants, such as flowering, fruiting, bud blast, bud formation, and growth cessation, are often controlled seasonally. Although temperature and photoperiod are the two major seasonal cues for such responses, the importance of phase lag between annual oscillations of the two signals has been unexplored, despite its universal nature in the context of seasonal environments. In this article, the phase-lag calendar hypothesis (New Phytologist, 210, 2016, 399), especially the one between temperature and photoperiod, is explained using meteorological data obtained from central Japan as an example. We set forth to show how, for a narrow window in time of a couple of weeks in a year, simple threshold responses to these two signals that differ in annual oscillation phases are enough to make developmental plasticity to be expressed as phenological events. The properties of the underlying mechanisms of the events in different seasons are further predicted, and the responses are compared with reported empirical examples. Because many organisms have evolved under the phase lag between photoperiod and temperature, the developmental plasticity in response to the phase lag should be evaluated for diverse organisms.},

	abstract = {This review considers the relationship between the lifespan of an individual plant and the longevity of its component cells, tissues and organs. It begins by defining the terms senescence, growth, development, turnover, ageing, death and program. Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms regulating phase change from juvenility to maturity influence directly the capacity for responding to senescence signals and factors determining reproduction-related patterns of deteriorative ageing and death. Senescence is responsive to communication between sources and sinks in which sugar signalling and hormonal regulation play central roles. Monocarpy and polycarpy represent contrasting outcomes of the balance between the determinacy of apical meristems and source–sink cross-talk. Even extremely long-lived perennials sustain a high degree of meristem integrity. Factors associated with deteriorative ageing in animals, such as somatic mutation, telomere attrition and the costs of repair and maintenance, do not seem to be particularly significant for plant lifespan, but autophagy-related regulatory networks integrated with nutrient signalling may have a part to play. Size is an important influence on physiological function and fitness of old trees. Self-control of modular structure allows trees to sustain viability over prolonged lifespans. Different turnover patterns of structural modules can account for the range of plant life histories and longevities. Contents Summary 696 I. Endgame theory 697 II. Terms and conditions 697 III.

The extent of whole-rosette senescence was determined by imaging the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm). • A major QTL on the top of chromosome 4 colocalized with FRI, a major determinant of flowering. This QTL interacted epistatically with a QTL on chromosome 5, where the floral repressor FLC localizes. Vernalization accelerated senescence in late-flowering lines with functional FRI and FLC alleles. Comparison with previous results using the Bay-0 × Shahdara population showed that rapid rosette senescence on glucose-containing medium was correlated with early flowering and high sugar content in compost-grown plants. In addition, correlation was found between the expression of flowering and senescence-associated genes in Arabidopsis accessions. However, an additional QTL on chromosome 3 was not linked to flowering, but to nitrogen-use efficiency. • The results show that whole-rosette senescence is genetically linked to the vernalization-dependent control of flowering, but is also controlled by flowering-independent pathways.},

Deficiencies in existing cultivars have underscored the need for a pragmatic breeding program. Since synchronization of flowering has a pronounced influence on genetic crosses that can be made, we assessed the flowering date and duration of 190 clones with selected clones similarly monitored for two additional growing seasons. Substantial genetic variation in the date and the duration of flowering were found with the onset of flowering ranging from 69 to 174 days after planting (DAP). Flowering duration ranged from 21 to 126 days. The onset of flowering was substantially affected by planting date and to a lesser extent by location. The results suggest that at lower latitudes flowering date for some clones can be manipulated by planting date; at higher latitudes, growth under controlled conditions may be required to synchronize flowering of some clones.},

Without a memory of past temperatures, it would be difficult for plants to detect seasons in natural, noisy environments because temperature changes occurring within a few weeks are often inconsistent with seasonal trends. Our 2-y census of the expression of a temperature-dependent flowering-time gene, AhgFLC, in a natural population of perennial Arabidopsis halleri revealed that the regulatory system of this flowering-time gene extracts seasonal cues as if it memorizes temperatures over the past 6 wk. Time-series analysis revealed that as much as 83\% of the variation in the AhgFLC expression is explained solely by the temperature for the previous 6 wk, but not by the temperatures over shorter or longer periods. The accuracy of our model in predicting the gene expression pattern under contrasting temperature regimes in the transplant experiments indicates that such modeling incorporating the molecular bases of flowering-time regulation will contribute to predicting plant responses to future climate changes.},

	abstract = {Background
It is essential to understand and predict the effects of changing environments on plants. This review focuses on the sexual reproduction of plants, as previous studies have suggested that this trait is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and because a number of ecologically and evolutionarily relevant genes have been identified.

Scope
It is proposed that studying gene functions in naturally fluctuating conditions, or gene functions in natura, is important to predict responses to changing environments. First, we discuss flowering time, an extensively studied example of phenotypic plasticity. The quantitative approaches of ecological and evolutionary systems biology have been used to analyse the expression of a key flowering gene, FLC, of Arabidopsis halleri in naturally fluctuating environments. Modelling showed that FLC acts as a quantitative tracer of the temperature over the preceding 6 weeks. The predictions of this model were verified experimentally, confirming its applicability to future climate changes. Second, the evolution of self-compatibility as exemplifying an evolutionary response is discussed. Evolutionary genomic and functional analyses have indicated that A. thaliana became self-compatible via a loss-of-function mutation in the male specificity gene, SCR/SP11. Self-compatibility evolved during glacial–interglacial cycles, suggesting its association with mate limitation during migration. Although the evolution of self-compatibility may confer short-term advantages, it is predicted to increase the risk of extinction in the long term because loss-of-function mutations are virtually irreversible.

Conclusions
Recent studies of FLC and SCR have identified gene functions in natura that are unlikely to be found in laboratory experiments. The significance of epigenetic changes and the study of non-model species with next-generation DNA sequencers is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Although multiple environmental cues regulate the transition to flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana, previous studies have suggested that wild A. thaliana accessions fall primarily into two classes, distinguished by their requirement for vernalization (extended winter-like temperatures), which enables rapid flowering under long days. Much of the difference in vernalization response is apparently due to variation at two epistatically acting loci, FRI and FLC. We present the response of over 150 wild accessions to three different environmental variables. In long days, FLC is among those genes whose expression is most highly correlated with flowering. In short days, FRI and FLC are less important, although their contribution is still significant. In addition, there is considerable variation not only in vernalization response, but also in the response to differences in day length or ambient growth temperature. The identification of accessions that flower relatively early or late in specific environments suggests that many of the flowering-time pathways identified by mutagenesis, such as those that respond to day length, contribute to flowering-time variation in the wild. In contrast to differences in vernalization requirement, which are mainly mediated by FRI and FLC, it seems that variation in these other pathways is due to allelic effects at several different loci.},

Vernalization is one example, in which flowering is promoted after plants have been exposed to a long-term cold temperature (i.e. winter). Vernalization results in the repression of floral repressor genes that inhibit the floral transition in many plant species. Here, we describe recent advances in our understanding of the vernalization-mediated promotion of flowering in Arabidopsis and other flowering plants. In Arabidopsis, the vernalization response includes the recruitment of chromatin-modifying complexes to floral repressors and thus results in the enrichment of repressive histone marks that ensure the stable repression of floral repressor genes. Changes in histone modifications at floral repressor loci are stably maintained after cold exposure, establishing the competence to flower the following spring. We also discuss similarities and differences in regulatory circuits in vernalization responses among Arabidopsis and other plants.},

Allele competition experiments suggest that l28 is a dominant-negative allele of the APETALA2 (AP2) gene, which previously has been implicated in floral patterning and seed development. Expression of both WUSCHEL (WUS) and CLAVATA3 (CLV3) genes, which regulate stem cell maintenance in the wild type, were disrupted in l28 shoot apices from early stages on. Unlike in floral patterning, AP2 mRNA is active in the center of the shoot meristem and acts via a mechanism independent of AGAMOUS, which is a repressor of WUS and stem cell maintenance in the floral meristem. Genetic analysis shows that termination of the primary shoot meristem in l28 mutants requires an active CLV signaling pathway, indicating that AP2 functions in stem cell maintenance by modifying the WUS-CLV3 feedback loop.},

Newly synthesized MYB3R4 protein resides predominantly in the cytoplasm. At the G2-to-M transition, rapid nuclear accumulation of MYB3R4-consistent with an associated transient peak in cytokinin concentration-feeds a positive feedback loop involving importins and initiates a transcriptional cascade that drives mitosis and cytokinesis.

Here, we show that type-B ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORs (ARRs), critical components of cytokinin signaling, activate the transcription of WUSCHEL (WUS), which encodes a key regulator for maintaining stem cells. In parallel, type-B ARRs inhibit auxin accumulation by repressing the expression of YUCCAs, which encode a key enzyme for auxin biosynthesis, indirectly promoting WUS induction. Both pathways are essential for de novo regeneration of the shoot stem cell niche. In addition, the dual regulation of type-B ARRs on WUS transcription is required for the maintenance of the shoot apical meristem in planta. Thus, our results reveal a long-standing missing link between cytokinin signaling and WUS regulator, and the findings provide critical information for understanding cell fate specification.},

We show that most models allow for self-organised patterning for similar biological assumptions, and find that the pattern generated is typically unidirectional, unless additional assumptions or mechanisms are incorporated. Our analysis thus suggests that current models cannot explain the bidirectional fountain-type patterns found in plant meristems in a fully self-organised manner, and we discuss future research directions to address the gaps in our understanding of auxin transport mechanisms.},

Recently, the importance of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) signaling in priming stem cell differentiation has been extensively studied in animals. Here, we show that different forms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) have antagonistic roles in plant stem cell regulation, which were established by distinct spatiotemporal patterns of ROS-metabolizing enzymes. The superoxide anion () is markedly enriched in stem cells to activate WUSCHEL and maintain stemness, whereas H2O2 is more abundant in the differentiating peripheral zone to promote stem cell differentiation. Moreover, H2O2 negatively regulates biosynthesis in stem cells, and increasing H2O2 levels or scavenging leads to the termination of stem cells. Our results provide a mechanistic framework for ROS-mediated control of plant stem cell fate and demonstrate that the balance between and H2O2 is key to stem cell maintenance and differentiation.},

The use of previous environmental experiences, such as the conditions when the seed formed or whether winter has passed, is critical to maximise reproductive success. Temperature is a crucial signal in achieving this, it provides current seasonal information and is an indicator of forthcoming environmental conditions, including drought or freezing. Therefore, many temperature responses facilitate environmental acclimation as well as trigger key developmental changes, such as germination, growth, and flowering. Research has identified that temperature signals are interpreted in the context of light signalling, circadian and light intensity, and developmental stage. Furthermore, a number of temperature cues are stress signals, associated with very high or low temperatures. These signals do trigger developmental responses but not as part of standard developmental growth. This article focuses on the role of ambient temperature on each of the major stages of plant development.},

	abstract = {Plant development is orchestrated and yet flexible. This enables the formation of the correct organs within the context of previous and current environmental cues. The use of previous environmental experiences, such as the conditions when the seed formed or whether winter has passed, is critical to maximise reproductive success. Temperature is a crucial signal in achieving this, it provides current seasonal information and is an indicator of forthcoming environmental conditions, including drought or freezing. Therefore, many temperature responses facilitate environmental acclimation as well as trigger key developmental changes, such as germination, growth, and flowering. Research has identified that temperature signals are interpreted in the context of light signalling, circadian and light intensity, and developmental stage. Furthermore, a number of temperature cues are stress signals, associated with very high or low temperatures. These signals do trigger developmental responses but not as part of standard developmental growth. This article focuses on the role of ambient temperature on each of the major stages of plant development.},

	abstract = {Winter-annual ecotypes of Arabidopsis are relatively late flowering, unless the flowering of these ecotypes is promoted by exposure to cold (vernalization). This vernalization-suppressible, late-flowering phenotype results from the presence of dominant, late-flowering alleles at two loci, FRIGIDA (FRI) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). In this study, we report that flc null mutations result in early flowering, demonstrating that the role of active FLC alleles is to repress flowering. FLC was isolated by positional cloning and found to encode a novel MADS domain protein. The levels of FLC mRNA are regulated positively by FRI and negatively by LUMINIDEPENDENS. FLC is also negatively regulated by vernalization. Overexpression of FLC from a heterologous promoter is sufficient to delay flowering in the absence of an active FRI allele. We propose that the level of FLC activity acts through a rheostat-like mechanism to control flowering time in Arabidopsis and that modulation of FLC expression is a component of the vernalization response.},

The ga1-3 mutant, which is severely defective in ent-kaurene synthesis because it lacks most of the GA1 gene, never flowered in SD unless treated with exogenous gibberellin. After a prolonged period of vegetative growth, this mutant eventually underwent senescence without having produced flower buds. The gai mutant and the "leaky" ga1-6 mutant did flower in SD, but took somewhat longer than WT. All the mutants flowered readily in CL, although the ga1-3 mutant showed some delay. Unlike WT and ga1-3, the gai mutant failed to respond to gibberellin treatment by accelerating flowering in SD. A cold treatment promoted flowering in the WT and gai, but failed to induce flowering in ga1-3.

In the companion paper, rapid LD increases in FT expression associated with flowering driven photosynthetically in red light were documented. In a far red (FR)-rich LD, along with FT there was a potential role for gibberellin (GA). Here, with the GA biosynthesis dwarf mutant ga1-3, GA4-treated plants flowered after 26 d in short days (SD) but untreated plants were still vegetative after 6 months. Not only was FT expression low in SD but applied GA bypassed some of the block to flowering in ft-1. On transfer to LD, ga1-3 only flowered when treated simultaneously with GA, and FT expression increased rapidly ({\textless}19.5 h) and dramatically (15-fold). In contrast, in the wild type in LD there was little requirement for GA for FT increase and flowering so its endogenous GA content was near to saturating. Despite this permissive role for endogenous GA in Columbia, RNA interference (RNAi) silencing of the GA biosynthesis gene, GA 20-OXIDASE2, revealed an additional, direct role for GA in LD. Flowering took twice as long after silencing the LD-regulated gene, GA 20-OXIDASE2. Such independent LD input by FT and GA reflects their non-sympatric expression (FT in the leaf blade and GA 20-OXIDASE2 in the petiole). Overall, FT acts as the main LD floral signal in Columbia and GA acts on flowering both via and independently of FT.},

We also demonstrate that PTM, a PHD transcription factor involved in chloroplast retrograde signaling, perceives such a signal and mediates transcriptional repression of FLC through recruitment of FVE, a component of the histone deacetylase complex.

	abstract = {Plants detect changes in day length to induce seasonal patterns of flowering. The photoperiodic pathway accelerates the flowering of Arabidopsis thaliana under long days (LDs) whereas it is inactive under short days (SDs), resulting in delayed flowering. This delay is overcome by exposure of plants to high temperature (27°C) under SDs (27°C-SD). Previously, the high-temperature flowering response was proposed to involve either the impaired activity of MADS-box transcription factor (TF) floral repressors or PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) TF-mediated activation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), which encodes the output signal of the photoperiodic pathway. We integrate these observations by studying several PIFs, the MADS-box SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) and the photoperiodic pathway under 27°C-SD. We find that the mRNAs of FT and its paralogue TWIN SISTER OF FT (TSF) are increased at dusk under 27°C-SD compared with 21°C-SD, and that this requires PIF4 and PIF5 as well as CONSTANS (CO), a TF that promotes flowering under LDs. The CO and PIF4 proteins are present at dusk under 27°C-SD, and they physically interact. Although Col-0 plants flower at similar times under 27°C-SD and 21°C-LD the expression level of FT is approximately 10-fold higher under 21°C-LD, suggesting that responsiveness to FT is also increased under 27°C-SD, perhaps as a result of the reduced activity of SVP in the meristem. Accordingly, only svp-41 ft-10 tsf-1 plants flowered at the same time under 21°C-SD and 27°C-SD. Thus, we propose that under non-inductive SDs, elevated temperatures increase the activity and sensitize the response to the photoperiod pathway.},

Previous work has identified the interplay of PIF4 and ELF3 as a central circuit underlying thermal responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, thermal responses vary widely among strains, possibly offering mechanistic insights into the wiring of this circuit. ELF3 contains a polyglutamine (polyQ) tract that is crucial for ELF3 function and varies in length across strains. Here, we use transgenic analysis to test the hypothesis that natural polyQ variation in ELF3 is associated with the observed natural variation in thermomorphogenesis. We found little evidence that the polyQ tract plays a specific role in thermal responses beyond modulating general ELF3 function. Instead, we made the serendipitous discovery that ELF3 plays a crucial, PIF4-independent role in thermoresponsive flowering under conditions more likely to reflect field conditions. We present evidence that ELF3 acts through the photoperiodic pathway, pointing to a previously unknown symmetry between low and high ambient temperature responses. Moreover, in analyzing two strain backgrounds with different thermal responses, we demonstrate that responses may be shifted rather than fundamentally rewired across strains. Our findings tie together disparate observations into a coherent framework in which multiple pathways converge in accelerating flowering in response to temperature, with some such pathways modulated by photoperiod.},

	abstract = {Background
It is essential to understand and predict the effects of changing environments on plants. This review focuses on the sexual reproduction of plants, as previous studies have suggested that this trait is particularly vulnerable to climate change, and because a number of ecologically and evolutionarily relevant genes have been identified.

Scope
It is proposed that studying gene functions in naturally fluctuating conditions, or gene functions in natura, is important to predict responses to changing environments. First, we discuss flowering time, an extensively studied example of phenotypic plasticity. The quantitative approaches of ecological and evolutionary systems biology have been used to analyse the expression of a key flowering gene, FLC, of Arabidopsis halleri in naturally fluctuating environments. Modelling showed that FLC acts as a quantitative tracer of the temperature over the preceding 6 weeks. The predictions of this model were verified experimentally, confirming its applicability to future climate changes. Second, the evolution of self-compatibility as exemplifying an evolutionary response is discussed. Evolutionary genomic and functional analyses have indicated that A. thaliana became self-compatible via a loss-of-function mutation in the male specificity gene, SCR/SP11. Self-compatibility evolved during glacial–interglacial cycles, suggesting its association with mate limitation during migration. Although the evolution of self-compatibility may confer short-term advantages, it is predicted to increase the risk of extinction in the long term because loss-of-function mutations are virtually irreversible.

Conclusions
Recent studies of FLC and SCR have identified gene functions in natura that are unlikely to be found in laboratory experiments. The significance of epigenetic changes and the study of non-model species with next-generation DNA sequencers is also discussed.},

Additionally, miR156 levels decline as A. alpina ages, causing increased production of SPL (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN LIKE) transcription factors and ensuring that flowering occurs in response to cold.

Much less work has been done on the potentially more complicated question of how flowering is regulated in perennials, which live for many years and undergo repeated cycles of flowering and vegetative growth. Now a study of flowering in Arabis alpina, a perennial related to A. thaliana, identifies a gene, PEP1 (perpetual flowering 1), that regulates three key traits of perennials. It is involved in limiting flowering duration, in stopping some branches from flowering at all, and in restricting flowering to spring. PEP1 is the orthologue of the FLC flowering repressor in A. thaliana, which, through chromatin modification, inhibits flowering until the plant is exposed to cold temperatures. PEP1 has functions in the perennial that are not represented in the annual, and these appear have evolved through changes in histone modification at the FLC and PEP1 loci.},

The FT protein then acts as a florigen that is transported to the shoot apical meristem, where it physically interacts with the Basic Leucine Zipper Domain transcription factor FD and 14-3-3 proteins. However, despite the importance of FD in promoting flowering, its direct transcriptional targets are largely unknown. Here, we combined chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and RNA sequencing to identify targets of FD at the genome scale and assessed the contribution of FT to DNA binding. We further investigated the ability of FD to form protein complexes with FT and TERMINAL FLOWER1 through interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. Importantly, we observed direct binding of FD to targets involved in several aspects of plant development. These target genes were previously unknown to be directly related to the regulation of flowering time. Our results confirm FD as a central regulator of floral transition at the shoot meristem and provide evidence for crosstalk between the regulation of flowering and other signaling pathways, such as pathways involved in hormone signaling.},

However, the position of FUL in these genetic networks, as well as the functional output of FUL activity during floral transition, remains unclear. In this work, a genetic approach has been undertaken to understand better the functional hierarchies involving FUL and other MADS-box factors with well established roles as floral integrators such as SOC1, short vegetative phase (svp) or flowering locus C (FLC). Our results suggest a prominent role of FUL in promoting reproductive transition when photoinductive signalling is suppressed by short-day conditions or by high levels of FLC expression, as in non-vernalized winter ecotypes.

SOC1 is regulated by two antagonistic flowering regulators, CONSTANS (CO) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), which act as floral activator and repressor, respectively. CO activates SOC1 mainly through FT but FLC represses SOC1 by direct binding to the promoter. SOC1 is also activated by an age-dependent mechanism in which SPL9 and microRNA156 are involved. When SOC1 is induced at the shoot apex, SOC1 together with AGL24 directly activates LEAFY (LFY), a floral meristem identity gene. APETALA1 (AP1), activated mainly by FT, is also necessary to establish and maintain flower meristem identity. When LFY and AP1 are established, flower development occurs at the anlagen of shoot apical meristem according to the ABC model. During early flower development, AP1 activates the A function and represses three redundantly functioning flowering time genes, SOC1, AGL24, and SVP to prevent floral reversion. During late flower development, such repression is also necessary to activate SEPALATA3 (SEP3) which is a coactivator of B and C function genes with LFY, otherwise SEP3 is suppressed by SOC1, AGL24, and SVP. Therefore, SOC1 is necessary to prevent premature differentiation of the floral meristem.},

	abstract = {Wheat cultivars exposed to optimal photoperiod and vernalization treatments still exhibit differences in flowering time, referred to as earliness per se (Eps). We previously identified the Eps-Am1 locus from Triticum monococcum and showed that the allele from cultivated accession DV92 significantly delays heading time and increases the number of spikelets per spike relative to the allele from wild accession G3116. Here, we expanded a high-density genetic and physical map of the Eps-Am1 region and identified the wheat ortholog of circadian clock regulator EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) as a candidate gene. No differences in ELF3 transcript levels were found between near-isogenic lines carrying the DV92 and G3116 Eps-Am1 alleles, but the encoded ELF3 proteins differed in four amino acids. These differences were associated with altered transcription profiles of PIF-like, PPD1, and FT1, which are known downstream targets of ELF3. Tetraploid wheat lines with combined truncation mutations in the A- and B-genome copies of ELF3 flowered earlier and had less spikelets per spike than the wild-type control under short- and long-day conditions. Both effects were stronger in a photoperiod-sensitive than in a reduced photoperiod-sensitive background, indicating a significant epistatic interaction between PPD1 and ELF3 (P {\textless} 0.0001). By contrast, the introgression of the T. monococcum chromosome segment carrying the Eps-Am1 allele from DV92 into durum wheat delayed flowering and increased the number of spikelets per spike. Taken together, the above results support the hypothesis that ELF3 is Eps-Am1. The ELF3 alleles identified here provide additional tools to modulate reproductive development in wheat.},

	abstract = {The photoperiodic response is critical for plants to adjust their reproductive phase to the most favorable season. Wheat heads earlier under long days (LD) than under short days (SD) and this difference is mainly regulated by the PHOTOPERIOD1 (PPD1) gene. Tetraploid wheat plants carrying the Ppd-A1a allele with a large deletion in the promoter head earlier under SD than plants carrying the wildtype Ppd-A1b allele with an intact promoter. Phytochromes PHYB and PHYC are necessary for the light activation of PPD1, and mutations in either of these genes result in the downregulation of PPD1 and very late heading time. We show here that both effects are reverted when the phyB mutant is combined with loss-of-function mutations in EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3), a component of the Evening Complex (EC) in the circadian clock. We also show that the wheat ELF3 protein interacts with PHYB and PHYC, is rapidly modified by light, and binds to the PPD1 promoter in planta (likely as part of the EC). Deletion of the ELF3 binding region in the Ppd-A1a promoter results in PPD1 upregulation at dawn, similar to PPD1 alleles with intact promoters in the elf3 mutant background. The upregulation of PPD1 is correlated with the upregulation of the florigen gene FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (FT1) and early heading time. Loss-of-function mutations in PPD1 result in the downregulation of FT1 and delayed heading, even when combined with the elf3 mutation. Taken together, these results indicate that ELF3 operates downstream of PHYB as a direct transcriptional repressor of PPD1, and that this repression is relaxed both by light and by the deletion of the ELF3 binding region in the Ppd-A1a promoter. In summary, the regulation of the light mediated activation of PPD1 by ELF3 is critical for the photoperiodic regulation of wheat heading time.},

	abstract = {Plant breeders have indirectly selected for variation at circadian-associated loci in many of the world's major crops, when breeding to increase yield and improve crop performance. Using an eight-parent Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) population, we investigated how variation in circadian clock-associated genes contributes to the regulation of heading date in UK and European winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) varieties. We identified homoeologues of EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) as candidates for the Earliness per se (Eps) D1 and B1 loci under field conditions. We then confirmed a single-nucleotide polymorphism within the coding region of TaELF3-B1 as a candidate polymorphism underlying the Eps-B1 locus. We found that a reported deletion at the Eps-D1 locus encompassing TaELF3-D1 is, instead, an allele that lies within an introgression region containing an inversion relative to the Chinese Spring D genome. Using Triticum turgidum cv. Kronos carrying loss-of-function alleles of TtELF3, we showed that ELF3 regulates heading, with loss of a single ELF3 homoeologue sufficient to alter heading date. These studies demonstrated that ELF3 forms part of the circadian oscillator; however, the loss of all homoeologues was required to affect circadian rhythms. Similarly, loss of functional LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX) in T. aestivum, an orthologue of a protein partner of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ELF3, severely disrupted circadian rhythms. ELF3 and LUX transcripts are not co-expressed at dusk, suggesting that the structure of the wheat circadian oscillator might differ from that of Arabidopsis. Our demonstration that alterations to ELF3 homoeologues can affect heading date separately from effects on the circadian oscillator suggests a role for ELF3 in cereal photoperiodic responses that could be selected for without pleiotropic deleterious alterations to circadian rhythms.},

	abstract = {\textit{EARLY FLOWERING 3} (\textit{ELF3}), a light zeitnehmer (time-taker) gene, regulates circadian rhythm and photoperiodic flowering in Arabidopsis, rice, and barley. The three orthologs of \textit{ELF3} (\textit{TaELF3-1AL}, \textit{TaELF3-1BL}, and \textit{TaELF3-1DL}) have been identified in wheat too, and one gene, \textit{TaELF3-1DL}, has been associated with heading date. However, the basic characteristics of these three genes and the roles of the other two genes, \textit{TaELF3-1BL} and, \textit{TaELF3-1AL}, remain unknown. Therefore, the present study obtained the coding sequences of the three orthologs (\textit{TaELF3-1AL}, \textit{TaELF3-1BL}, and \textit{TaELF3-1DL}) of \textit{ELF3 }from bread wheat and characterized them and investigated the role of \textit{TaELF3-1BL} in Arabidopsis. Protein sequence comparison revealed similarities among the three \textit{TaELF3} genes of wheat; however, they were different from the Arabidopsis \textit{ELF3}. Real-time quantitative PCR revealed \textit{TaELF3} expression in all wheat tissues tested, with the highest expression in young spikes; the three genes showed rhythmic expression patterns also. Furthermore, the overexpression of the \textit{TaELF3-1BL} gene in Arabidopsis delayed flowering, indicating their importance in flowering. Subsequent overexpression of \textit{TaELF3-1BL} in the Arabidopsis \textit{ELF3} nonfunctional mutant (\textit{elf3 }mutant) eliminated its early flowering phenotype, and slightly delayed flowering. The wild-type Arabidopsis overexpressing \textit{TaELF3-1BL} demonstrated reduced expression levels of flowering-related genes, such as \textit{CONSTANS} (\textit{AtCO}), \textit{FLOWERING LOCUS T} (\textit{AtFT}), and \textit{GIGANTEA} (\textit{AtGI}). Thus, the study characterized the three \textit{TaELF3} genes and associated \textit{TaELF3-1BL} with flowering in Arabidopsis, suggesting a role in regulating flowering in wheat too. These findings provide a basis for further research on \textit{TaELF3} functions in wheat.},

The perception of changes in day length is one of the most reliable cues of seasonal change, and this involves the interplay between the sensing of light signals and the circadian clock. Here, we describe a Brachypodium distachyon mutant allele of the evening complex protein EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3). We show that the elf3 mutant flowers more rapidly than wild type plants in short days as well as under longer photoperiods but, in very long (20 h) days, flowering is equally rapid in elf3 and wild type. Furthermore, flowering in the elf3 mutant is still sensitive to vernalization, but not to ambient temperature changes. Molecular analyses revealed that the expression of a short-day marker gene is suppressed in elf3 grown in short days, and the expression patterns of clock genes and flowering time regulators are altered. We also explored the mechanisms of photoperiodic perception in temperate grasses by exposing B. distachyon plants grown under a 12 h photoperiod to a daily night break consisting of a mixture of red and far-red light. We showed that 2 h breaks are sufficient to accelerate flowering in B. distachyon under non-inductive photoperiods and that this acceleration of flowering is mediated by red light. Finally, we discuss advances and perspectives for research on the perception of photoperiod in temperate grasses.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Precise regulation of flowering time is critical for cereal crops to synchronize reproductive development with optimum environmental conditions, thereby maximizing grain yield. The plant specific gene
            GIGANTEA
            (
            GI
            ) plays an important role in the control of flowering time, with additional functions on the circadian clock and plant stress responses. In this study, we show that
            GI
            loss-of-function mutants in a photoperiod sensitive tetraploid wheat background exhibit significant delays in heading time under both long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) photoperiods, with stronger effects under LD. However, this interaction between GI and photoperiod is no longer observed in isogenic lines carrying either a photoperiod insensitive allele in the
            PHOTOPERIOD1
            (
            PPD1
            ) gene or a loss-of-function allele in
            EARLY FLOWERING 3
            (
            ELF3
            ), a known repressor of
            PPD1.
            These results suggest that the normal circadian regulation of
            PPD1
            is required for the differential effect of
            GI
            on heading time in different photoperiods. Using crosses between mutants or transgenic of
            GI
            and those of critical genes in the flowering regulation pathway, we show that
            GI
            accelerates wheat heading time by promoting
            FLOWERING LOCUS T1
            (
            FT1
            ) expression via interactions with

            GI
            mechanisms between wheat and Arabidopsis, but also identifies specific interactions of GI with the distinctive photoperiod and vernalization pathways of the temperate grasses. These results provide valuable knowledge for modulating wheat heading time and engineering new varieties better adapted to a changing environment.},

              Mother plants play an important role in the control of dormancy and dispersal characters of their progeny. In Arabidopsis seed dormancy is imposed by the embryo-surrounding tissues of the endosperm and seed coat.

Furthermore, VEL3 preferentially associates with pericentromeric chromatin and is required for deacetylation and H3K27me3 deposition established in the central cell.

Herein we demonstrate that the endosperm-expressed transcription factors ZHOUPI (ZOU) and INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION1 (ICE1) play a role in determining the depth of primary dormancy in Arabidopsis. We show that ice1 or zou increases seed dormancy and the double mutant has an additive phenotype. This increased dormancy is associated with increased ABA levels, and can be separated genetically from any role in endosperm maturation because loss of ABA biosynthesis or DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 reverses the dormancy phenotype without affecting the aberrant seed morphology. Consistent with these results, ice1 endosperms had an increased capacity for preventing embryo greening, a phenotype previously associated with an increase in endospermic ABA levels. Although ice1 changes the expression of many genes, including some in ABA biosynthesis, catabolism and/or signalling, only ABA INSENSITIVE 3 is signiﬁcantly misregulated in ice1 mutants. We also demonstrate that ICE1 binds to and inhibits expression of ABA INSENSITIVE 3. Our data demonstrate that Arabidopsis ICE1 and ZOU determine the depth of primary dormancy during maturation independently of their effect on endosperm development.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Seed behavior is known to be highly dependent on the temperature during seed set, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Here we show that the mother plant plays a central role in the control of progeny seed dormancy, integrating long-term temperature memories in fruit tissues using the same pathway that controls flowering time. Regulation of seed coat properties by maternal flowering time pathways effectively passes timing information across generations, aligning progeny behavior with time of year.
          , 
            
              Seasonal behavior is important for fitness in temperate environments but it is unclear how progeny gain their initial seasonal entrainment. Plants use temperature signals to measure time of year, and changes to life histories are therefore an important consequence of climate change. Here we show that in
              Arabidopsis
              the current and prior temperature experience of the mother plant is used to control germination of progeny seeds, via the activation of the florigen Flowering Locus T (FT) in fruit tissues. We demonstrate that maternal past and current temperature experience are transduced to the FT locus in silique phloem. In turn, FT controls seed dormancy through inhibition of proanthocyanidin synthesis in fruits, resulting in altered seed coat tannin content. Our data reveal that maternal temperature history is integrated through FT in the fruit to generate a metabolic signal that entrains the behavior of progeny seeds according to time of year.},

	abstract = {After domestication in the Near East around 10,000 years ago several founder crops, flax included, spread to European latitudes. On reaching northerly latitudes the architecture of domesticated flax became more suitable to fiber production over oil, with longer stems, smaller seeds and fewer axillary branches. Latitudinal adaptations in crops typically result in changes in flowering time, often involving the PEBP family of genes that also have the potential to influence plant architecture. Two PEBP family genes in the flax genome, LuTFL1 and LuTFL2, vary in wild and cultivated flax over latitudinal range with cultivated flax receiving LuTFL1 alleles from northerly wild flax populations. Compared to a background of population structure of flaxes over latitude, the LuTFL1 alleles display a level of differentiation that is consistent with selection for an allele III in the north. We demonstrate through heterologous expression in Arabidopsis thaliana that LuTFL1 is a functional homolog of TFL1 in A. thaliana capable of changing both flowering time and plant architecture. We conclude that specialized fiber flax types could have formed as a consequence of a natural adaptation of cultivated flax to higher latitudes.},

New results show that the polar IAA export of the earlier developed sink inhibits the IAA export of later developed sinks. This ‘autoinhibition’ occurs at ‘junctions’, where auxin streams from various sinks meet. It is suggested that this depressed IAA-export of the subordinated fruit/sink acts as the signal that leads to inhibited development. This hypothesis avoids some of the problems related with other hypotheses, such as the requirement of a multidirectional signal. Primigenic dominance is a unifying hypothesis, which can be applied to most correlative dominance phenomena in the plant.

	abstract = {The less-than sign is a mathematical symbol that denotes an inequality between two values. The widely adopted form of two equal-length strokes connecting in an acute angle at the left, {\textless}, has been found in documents dated as far back as the 1560s. In mathematical writing, the less-than sign is typically placed between two values being compared and signifies that the first number is less than the second number. Examples of typical usage include 1⁄2 {\textless} 1 and −2 {\textless} 0. 
Since the development of computer programming languages, the less-than sign and the greater-than sign have been repurposed for a range of uses and operations.},

	abstract = {Plant development is orchestrated and yet flexible. This enables the formation of the correct organs within the context of previous and current environmental cues. The use of previous environmental experiences, such as the conditions when the seed formed or whether winter has passed, is critical to maximise reproductive success. Temperature is a crucial signal in achieving this, it provides current seasonal information and is an indicator of forthcoming environmental conditions, including drought or freezing. Therefore, many temperature responses facilitate environmental acclimation as well as trigger key developmental changes, such as germination, growth, and flowering. Research has identified that temperature signals are interpreted in the context of light signalling, circadian and light intensity, and developmental stage. Furthermore, a number of temperature cues are stress signals, associated with very high or low temperatures. These signals do trigger developmental responses but not as part of standard developmental growth. This article focuses on the role of ambient temperature on each of the major stages of plant development.},
